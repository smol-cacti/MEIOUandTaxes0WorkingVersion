#Scripted triggers that define conditions which limit a building being built and preventing it from dissappearing
#
#'can_build' describes the conditions that need to be fulfilled to construct the building. You can accuractely limit
# construction of buildings by event or decision using this trigger only.
#
#'can_keep' describes the conditions that allow the building the stay in the province without being destroyed automatically
# This is include in 'can_build' and is seperated to reduce clutter, seperate logic, and for use in building files
#
# The NOT = { has_building = itself } is to prevent events from thinking they can build buildings already present.
#
#

#Rosth
#replaced urban_pop with urban_pop_display just for the sake of convenience
#added urban_pop_to_gravity_ratio, which is urban_pop_display divided by urban_gravity_total in order to stop the AI from building city hall buildings when urban gravity is already way ahead of actual urban pop

####### Can Keep, if this trigger fails, the building disappears.
#### Use can_build instead for limiting event construction, can_keeps have to be first in the file for technical reasons.
