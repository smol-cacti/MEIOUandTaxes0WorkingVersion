###### DIPLO FIX FOR ORDER WARRING SAME RELIGION # STEVE-O ######

#Rosth: removed
#Reason: only three countries (knights, livonian order and the teutons) have the specified reforms
#Every single country would check whether they are a holy order every single month, and *then* they'd need to check every country that they know
#All for a fairly inconsequential country modifier
