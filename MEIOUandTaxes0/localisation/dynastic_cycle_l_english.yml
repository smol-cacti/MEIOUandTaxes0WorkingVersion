It started when Ying Feizi was granted a small fief in western regions of Zhou dynasty in ninth century BC. The state was minor at first, but through the tremulous centuries of Spring and Autumn and Waring States periods it grew to dominate former Zhou dominion and, through conquest, united China under centralised rule for the first time in 221 BC. Ying Zheng, by proclaiming himself the Emperor, laid foundation for the Imperial history of China. However, the unity was short-lived and Qin fell under its own weight in 206 BC. The title was later resurrected during Sixteen Kingdoms period after fall of Jin dynasty. First, Former Qin, was founded by Fu Jian, a general of Di ethnicity, in 351 CE. The state for a time managed to unify the North, however, it fell in 394 CE while being attacked by its neighbours and traitors.

After securing countless military victories against northern barbarians he forced Emperor of Jin to abdicate and declared rise of (Liu) Song dynasty. It lasted 59 years before succumbing to rebellions and invasions from the north. Another Song was created by Zhao Kuangyin during Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms period. He declared himself Emperor in 960 CE after forcing last Emperor of Later Zhou dynasty to relinquish the title. Song dynasty is considered the most prosperous and paradoxically peaceful period. Even though Song had to share Northern China with Tangut Western Xia, Khitan Liao and later Jurchen Jin dynasties, apart from early wars there was little conflict between all sides. Song finally fell in 1279 CE after onslaught from Mongol forces led by Kublai Khan, who declared later Yuan dynasty. Finally the last pretenders who claimed descent from imperial family of Song was Han Shantong and his son Han Lin'er. During the Red Turban rebellion Han Lin'er was considered the legitimate next Emperor of China free from Mongol overlordship. However he drowned in 1367 CE which further led to rise of Ming dynasty.

Centuries later, in the last years of Han dynasty, Emperor Xian conferred upon his defender, Cao Cao, title of Duke of Wei. In 216 CE, three years later, the title was elevated to King of Wei and after Cao Cao's death it passed to his son, Cao Pi. He forced Emperor Xian to abdicate and placed himself on a throne as Emperor of Wei in 220, which in turn led Liu Bei and Sun Quan to proclaim their own dynasties. It lasted 45 years before last Emperor of Wei, Cao Huan, was in turn forced to abdicate to Sima Zhao, the first Emperor of Jin. During Sixteen Kingdoms period the title of Emperor of Wei was claimed briefly by Ran Min between 350 and 352 CE. A hateful person, he ordered mass executions and genocide of Jie people. Last Wei of significance was proclaimed by Xianbei Touba clan. Their Northern Wei dynasty lasted since its proclamation in 386 CE by Touba Gui, until its division in 536 CE into Western Wei and Eastern Wei. The division was created by the policies of sinicization and succession troubles, with factions fighting for power in the court, which led two general Gao Huan and Yuwen Tai to elevate their own Emperors to the throne. Both western and eastern parts didn't last long. Eastern Wei was ended in 550 CE by Gao Huan's son, Gao Yang, who took the throne for himself and proclaimed Northern Qi. Western Wei was in turn taken over by Yuwen Tai's son, Yuwen Jue, who under regency of Yuwen Hu, declared rise of Northern Zhou. After centuries of division, will Wei gave rise to a stable dynasty?"

Another Chu was proclaimed in 403 CE by Huan Xuan after he took the throne from Emperor Sima Dezong of Jin. However his regime was defeated only a year later. Last Chu to rise was a kingdom created by Ma Yin in 907 CE, during the Southern Northern Dynasties period. During his reign it enjoyed peace and prosperity, but after his death it fell into succession struggles and was conquered by Southern Tang in 951 CE. Will this name of old be of any help to rebels??"
