 court.001.t:1 "$MONARCH$'s Court"
 court.001.d:1 "As the ruler of $COUNTRY$, $MONARCH$ was expected to live in a style fit for a $MONARCHTITLE$, and maintain a court to match $RULER_ADJ$ power - and $RULER_ADJ$ ambitions.\n\nMaintaining a proper court was usually the second-largest expense for a nation after paying for the army. Even a humble ruler had multiple palaces to maintain, servants to pay, feasts to hold, courtiers to entertain, art to commission and ceremonies to perform. Although the expense could be ruinous, a luxurious court was indispensable to a ruler. Ostentatious displays of wealth were not just for the $MONARCHTITLE$'s benefit - they were a public display of $RULER_ADJ$ power! This impressed foreign dignitaries and kept locals from considering rebellion. A lavish court also provided entertainment and pensioned positions for aristocrats, keeping them occupied jockeying for position at court rather than raising their banners against their liege."
