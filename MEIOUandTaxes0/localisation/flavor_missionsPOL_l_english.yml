 granary_of_europe_title:1 "Granary of Europe"
 granary_of_europe_desc:1 "Although the Commonwealth was Europe's largest grain producer, the bulk of her grain was consumed domestically. Estimated grain consumption in the Polish Crown (Poland proper) and Prussia in 1560–70 was some 113,000 tons of wheat. Average yearly production of grain in the Commonwealth in the sixteenth century was 120,000 tons, 6% of which was exported, while cities consumed some 19% and the remainder was consumed by the villages. Commonwealth grain achieved far more importance in poor crop years, as in the early 1590s and the 1620s, when governments throughout southern Europe arranged for large grain imports to cover shortfalls in their jurisdictions.\n\nBy improving our agricultural infrastructure, we can increase our profits and became main exporter of grain in Europe."
