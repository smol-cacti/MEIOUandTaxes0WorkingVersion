You can demand taxes and manpower from them, and they will vote on your request and come to a decision. Too many requests might anger them and increase the chances that they refuse. Also, you can increase the centralisation efforts in the Low Countries every 50 years. This increases the level of the Estates-General province modifier (there are 3 levels), thus reducing autonomy in the provinces. Also, increasing centralisation increases the money and manpower they give you upon accepting your tax/manpower requests.

The king's heroic conduct during the siege of Copenhagen in the winter of 1659 had, in addition, made him widely popular at a time when the nobility and the Rigsråd were increasingly being discredited. In October 1660, these events led the estates - the nobility only reluctantly - to create a hereditary monarchy. The new system meant that the king was no longer dependant on the Rigsråd, and he immediately used his new power to introduce absolutism, which was temporarily established on 10 January 1661 in the Hereditary Monarchy Act before being fully set out in Kongeloven (the King's Law) of 1665, the basic law of Danish absolutism."

Then he subjugated Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St. Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov.

The current Rigshofmester, Count Corfitz Ulfeldt, is also the brother-in-law of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and has ambitiously tried to extend the power of the council and the noble families of the realm. Attempts to divorce the count from his office has ended in failure as he has the support of the Nobility and full power of the administration. Ulfeldt is a skilled intrigue-maker and has in the past several times managed to outplay royal power and other adversaries, demonstrating his own authority through various devices.\nAs the sole administrator of the Sound Toll it is also believed that Ulfeldt may be siphoning significant state income but using this excuse to depose him would likely come at a high political cost."

From the 7,000 cases examined by the Inquisition during this year, only 31 have been finally accused. With purifying fire, 16 witches found guilty of witchcraft are burned to death. Although five of them were already death - they had died before the Auto de Fé -, justice has been done in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and the Holy Father of Rome. The proceeding will be suspended until the inquisitors have a chance to gather further evidence, on what is believed to be a widespread witch cult in the Basque Region. Alonso Salazar Frías, the junior inquisitor and lawyer by training is delegated to examine the matter at length."
 flavor_nav.102.a:1 "Fine."
 flavor_nav.103.n:1 "Second Phase Begins"
 flavor_nav.103.t:1 "The work of Alonso Salazar Frías has finished. Armed with an Edict of Grace, promising pardon to all those who voluntarily reported themselves and denounced their accomplices, Salazar has travelled across the countryside during this year. As expected, denunciations have flowed in. Alonso Salazar Frías has finally returned with confessions from close on 2,000 people, 1,384 of whom are children between the ages of seven and fourteen, implicating a further 5,000 named individuals. But according to the inquisitor, most of 1,802 people witnesses have retracted their statements before Salazar, attributing their confessions to torture. The evidence gathered covered 11,000 pages in all. Only six people out of 1,802 have maintained their confessions and have claimed to have returned to sabbaths. Salazar, the youngest judge in a panel of three, is also sceptical about the whole thing, saying that he had found no substantive proof of witchcraft on his travels, in spite of the manifold confessions. More than that, he questioned the whole basis of the trials. Because of this disagreement on how to proceed, the matter has been referred to the Inquisitor-General in Madrid. The senior judges, Alonso Becerra y Holquin and Juán del Valle Alvarado, have even gone so far as to accuse their colleague of being 'in league with the Devil'. Some of Salazar's objections are remarkable: 'The real question is: are we to believe that witchcraft occurred in a given situation simply because of what witches claim? No; it is clear that the witches are not to be believed, and the judges should not pass sentence on anyone, unless the case can be proven with external and objective evidence sufficient to convince everyone who hears it. And who accept the following: that a person can frequently fly through the air and travel hundreds of leagues in an hour; that a woman can get through a space not big enough for a fly; that a person can make herself invisible; that she can be in a river or the open sea and not get wet; or that she can be in bed at the sabbath at the same time... and that a witch can turn herself into any shape she fancies, be it housefly or raven? Indeed, these claims go beyond all human reason and may even pass the limits permitted by the Devil'."

The province of Navarra can now rest. - As a historical note: In August 1614 it ruled that all the trials pending at Logroño should be dismissed. At the same time it issued new and more rigorous rules of evidence, that brought witch-burning in Spain to an end, long before the Protestant North -."

You will begin the game with a series of Reinos that act as vassal states in the Netherlands and the Two Sicilies, to avoid a bug wherein you will randomly be assigned States out of your dispersed European possessions. This event will automatically annex them to the realm, but the Reinos will not go away.\nThe Reinos serve to model the historical privileges and liberties enjoyed by the nobles of the Two Sicilies and the Netherlands. While acknowledging Spanish rule on paper, in reality, these territories are ruled by a Viceroy appointed by the crown and enjoy considerable autonomy. Much like the Cortes you have doubtlessly already encountered in Spain itself, these special province modifiers provide a flat reduction in unrest, as well as bonus trade power, in exchange for a ticking increase in autonomy and a decrease in the level of taxation provided to your state. Respect the ancient liberties of the people of Naples and the Low Countries, and you will enjoy their support.\nIf you are not satisfied with this state of affairs, events will soon fire which allow you to alter the terms of your reinos' autonomy and their dependency upon the Crown, with perhaps disastrous consequences..."

Despite the betrothal, Sforza changed sides multiple times in the following years to both Venice and Florence, acquiring various fiefs in the process. Eventually he returned to the Milanese after being offered the title of Capitano Generale. \n\nFollowing the troubles the short-lived Ambrosian Republic brought upon Milan, the senate bestowed onto him the title Duke of Milan, due to his marriage to the late Duke's only natural child and his military prowess.
