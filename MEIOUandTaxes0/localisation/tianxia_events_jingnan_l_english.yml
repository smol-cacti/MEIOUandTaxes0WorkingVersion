 jingnan.1.t:1 "Zhu Biao's Disease"
 jingnan.1.d:1 "Zhu Biao was the Hongwu Emperor's first son and crown prince of the Ming Empire. Like his son, the Jianwen Emperor, Zhu Biao had a deep appreciation for traditional Chinese culture: he was involved in a survey of Xi'an and Luoyang as potential capitals for the dynasty when he fell ill and died in 1392 at the age of 36.

These instructions made it clear that the rule would pass only to children from the emperor's primary consort, excluding the Prince of Yan, Zhu Di, in favour of his nephew, Zhu Biao's son.
