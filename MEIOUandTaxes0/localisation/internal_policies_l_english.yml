 internal_policies.101.desc:1 "This event is designed to give you an idea how efforts in the Italian power struggle are faring.\n\nThe Italian peninsula is divided into five different types of powers: local, regional, major, dominant and menacing ones.\nThe first two gain economic advantages, major powers have a diplomatic bonus, whereas the last two have disadvantages in both areas. The power level is based on the development and art power of provinces owned in Italy, compared to all other Italian provinces and non-Italian owned provinces. Subjects are also taken into consideration, however being a vassal or the lesser partner of a union destroys the power of an Italian state. Major and Dominant powers have special options in a possible Italic League. All powers will oppose Dominant and Menacing powers, especially the latter ones. Expansion in Italian territory may have a big effect on the fragile system of Italian balance. The power status is checked each year, so it may take some months until a change will be notified.\n\nOur current Italian Power score is §G[This.italian_power.GetValue]%§!\n\nPower thresholds:\n§G66%§! within Italy: Italian power system disabled\n§G40%§!: Menacing power\n§G20%§!: Dominant power\n§G10%§!: Major power\n§G5%§!: Regional power\n§G2%§!: Local power"
