 ACT1530_NAME:1 "A Commendable Tranquillity"
 ACT1530_DESC:1 "It is the 9th year of Emperor Jiajing's reign, and all of China is at peace. Over a century ago the Ming forced out the Mongol Yuan and united the nation under their rule. In Burma, the Taungoo look to overthrow the corrupt rule of the Shan Confederates, whose hold on the land is tenuous as best. The Mac rulers of Vietnam are threatened by an uprising by southern lords in support of the old Le dynasty. Finally, the Jurchen tribes to the north are gathering their strength. How will the Son of Heaven respond to these developments?"
 TGE1530_NAME:1 "The Gunpowder Empires"
 TGE1530_DESC:1 "The Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal states represent the three great Muslim empires of the modern era, founded by rulers of Turkic origin. The Ottomans have secured control over Anatolia, the Levant, Egypt and the Balkans and are poised to strike deep into the heart of Europe, the Safavids have cemented their control over the Persian heartland and look towards the Caucasus while the Mughals seek to increase their domains in India.\nHowever, the ascendancy of each is not completely secure. The Hapsburgs, alarmed at the rapid expansion of the Ottomans, fight a war in Hungary over control of the kingdom. Uzbek raiders in the north have their eyes on the eastern Persian province of Khorasan. Finally, the Mughals face two threats to mastery of India, the Gujarat Sultanate under Qutb-ud-Din Bahadur Shah and the Afghani warlord Sher Suri in Bihar, each of whom is vying with the others for domination of Hindustan."
