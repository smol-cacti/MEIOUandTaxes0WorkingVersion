These men served their masters well, but also worked towards the rights and freedoms of their compatriots and ruffled feathers at court among good $COUNTRY_RELIGION$s who felt bypassed for an infidel.\n\nConsider carefully!

This all combined to make them excellent merchants, and some nations made use of these relationships to enhance trade. Others saw it as a dangerous heresy.\n\nConsider carefully!

Tales were told of them snatching babies, poisoning wells, betraying armies to the enemy, or secretly desecrating $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ scriptures and invoking the wrath of God on the entire nation. At times, such stories could spark a spontaneous pogrom against a minority, who were often powerless to protect themselves from the mob. Rulers were even known to orchestrate such pogroms themselves in order to turn the ire of the peasants away from their own flaws to an easy target - one they had no interest in dislodging permanently.\n\nConsider carefully!

Waiting until the heretics felt safe and their leaders were gathered in one spot - a wedding between two noble families in $CAPITAL$ - they struck, assassinating several leading heretic leaders and inciting the crowds of $CAPITAL_CITY$ into a hysteric mob that has begun to hunt down heretics. This bloody massacre gives us the opportunity to take control of the persecution and break the backs of heresy in $COUNTRY$.

Heretics complained that the rules were not always enforced and that they were forced to stay in certain areas and were unable to proselytize, while the church complained that the heresy was growing after being given state support. When religious violence broke out, it became clear that such edicts were not worth more than the paper they were printed on."

But the $MONARCHTITLE$, raised in another faith, had dreams of changing this. Soon after taking power, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ shocked the court at $CAPITAL_CITY$ by announcing bold new laws and measures that would effectively give the nation a new state religion! A great ruler could make $RULER_ADJ$ people follow, but it would take time and effort to stamp out the old beliefs. Did the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith have enough strength to fight this challenge? Or would the $MONARCHTITLE$ impose $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ will on the nation?"

Grumbling at the favour shown to nobles from other faiths, they have begun agitating for a repeal of the edict of toleration in $COUNTRY$, saying it goes too far. Meanwhile, heretic nobles are urging $MONARCH$ to take a stand and openly adopt their faith. Things are getting heated in $CAPITAL_CITY$..."

They are now staking everything on one glorious, bloody insurrection. We must pray for their victory over the ungodly rulers who have oppressed them for so long. Alternatively, we could take advantage of this distraction and strike a blow for both church and state!\n\nThe rebels will win if they can take the government-held provinces marked with the 'bastion of the church' modifier without losing the rebel-held provinces marked with the 'bastion of heresy' modifier. If we wish to intervene in this conflict, we should declare war and lay siege to the bastions of the church while guarding the bastions of heresy from them."
 dg_turmoil.068.d:1 "News has arrived of a bloody conflict breaking out between two faiths. One brutal persecution has inspired just as brutal a response, and now the nation is split into two armed camps eager to wipe the other out!

Execution is the time-honoured punishment for treason, but there are reasons to consider alternative solutions. Unlike many rebels, religious rebels had widespread support from their communities, so simply executing one charismatic leader might not quell revolts from the same community. As a result, some rulers punished all supporters of a heresy when a rebellion broke out, or drove them out of the country entirely.

This was fertile soil to grow scientists, and many famous scientists devoted themselves to God first, but science second. Gregor Mendel, Roger Bacon, Francesco Grimaldi, and dozens of other monks and priests expanded Man's knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, botany, physics, medicine, and other areas of science in the early modern era. Now we can add the name of $THEOLOGIAN$ to that list. For the most part, the reaction of the church to these cleric scientists was positive, but there were always those who regarded such men as a perversion of holy orders - clerics who had taken vows to devote themselves to the divine should not be studying worldly things."

 dg_church_influence.001.t:1 "The Dead Hand of the Church"
 dg_church_influence.001.d:1 "Occasionally pious worshippers donated land to the church, often in their wills as a bequest. Because the church itself owned the land rather than the priest in residence, it never passed into other hands. Since the church was not taxable, a great deal of wealth became concentrated in church hands. Although lieges could prevent their land from being donated, many independent estates were lost to the crown in this manner, and in some countries the church owned more than a third of all land!"

 dg_church_influence.004.d:1 "The church was one of the largest landowners in $COUNTRY$, so a sudden influx of their lands meant a vast number of properties to deal with. These could take many forms, from villages whose peasants paid taxes to a religious leader, to monasteries that farmed the land themselves, to shrines and temples that could be converted into other uses, to businesses owned and operated by the church. Some rulers transformed these properties into money to pay for wars or building projects by selling the lands off, while others doled them out to nobles in order to shore up their rule and stabilise the nation during times of turmoil. Still others saw it as an opportunity to increase the power of the state by turning them into state property.

Forced to rely largely on the voluntary donations of worshippers, it was inevitable that some temples would fall into disrepair or even be abandoned completely. Usually this was a minor inconvenience, requiring villages to hire an itinerant preacher to travel there several times a year for important rituals, but occasionally it was a national embarrassment when an ancient or beautiful place had to be shut to the public.

This was proof that the missionaries had great power - or were great evil.\n\nSuccessful missionaries could convert entire tribes, turning them into valuable allies and trading partners.

In other words, $MONARCH$ was $MONARCHTITLE$ through the grace of God (Dei Gratia).\n\nThis concept was naturally encouraged by rulers, but it was also espoused by religious leaders.

 dg_help.003.d:1 "Dei Gratia completely changes how religion works in the game. Many new religions have been added to the mod, such as Judaism, Sikhism or the different branches of Buddhism. Many of these have dedicated events, including some longer event chains like the Protestant Reformation. Provinces also have the chance to be split between different religions, allowing for religious minorities to exist. Naturally, this changes the way that conversion and missionaries work in the game. In addition, every country gets access to Piety and Church Influence, two features that affect religion in many ways. Which feature would you like explained?"

 dg_help.004.d:1 "The mechanics behind Dei Gratia can be processor-intensive, especially in mods that have larger maps. One of the easiest ways to compensate for this and so speed up the game noticeably is to check provinces less often. Choosing to turn on 'speed mode' means that the mod will prioritize speed over the religion system. Religious details will be checked six times less often, reducing redundant checks but also meaning it will take longer for the game to notice something has changed, like seeing your piety change after choosing a national idea or converting a province only to have it convert back years later. For some, that may be a small price to pay."

Instead of converting a province, they act as a signal to the game that it should focus missionary efforts on those provinces. Otherwise, the game will convert the largest, easiest target. The more missionaries you have and the higher your missionary strength, the faster this passive conversion will happen - but it will happen gradually and without telling the player when it happens.\n\nSince it is still experimental, it may not be balanced.

 dg_help.012.t:1 "Religious Minorities in Dei Gratia"
 dg_help.012.d:1 "Some parts of the world that were home to many competing faiths, such as India, Persia, and the Near East, were divided between religions. Zoroastrians fled to India to escape persecution in India. Pockets of Jews lived in ghettos in Europe, Buddhism was fading from India, and Sunni Muslims were making inroads in Indonesia. All of this can be represented in the game using the religious minority system.\n\nIn Dei Gratia, §Bevery province is divided into 21 populations which each have a religion§!. The mod checks each province's populations two to three times a year and decides which religion it should be. Other religions in the province are represented as modifiers whose effects depend on §Bhow much your country tolerates that religion§!. Having a Catholic minority in a province is great when you're Catholic, but not as nice when you're a Protestant, and a real pain when you're a Hindu.\n\nThe smallest possible minority modifier is a population of 2 (10% of the population). Below that, populations are counted but have no game effects."

 dg_help.014.t:1 "Piety in Dei Gratia"
 dg_help.014.d:1 "Every country has a §Gpiety§! rating, which determines how enthusiastic the population is about religion. You can see your country's piety rating by checking your country modifiers.\n\nPiety is rated from +100 (fanatical) to -100 (secular). The higher your piety, the more religious events you will receive, and the stronger their effects will be, both good and bad. In addition, pious countries gain bonuses to §Gtolerance of the state religion§!, §Glegitimacy§! and §Gmorale§!. However, pious countries also suffer a small penalty to §Rtolerance of other religions§!. On the other hand, the lower your piety, the fewer religious events you will receive, and the weaker their effects will be. Secular countries gain bonuses to §Gtolerance of other religions§!, §Gtechnology cost§! and §Greligious unity§!, but suffer a small penalty to §Rtolerance of the state religion§!.\n\nA country's piety can change according to circumstances, but usually only gradually. Piety is calculated behind the scenes two to three times a year. The single biggest component is §Bnational ideas§!. Each religious national idea increases a player's piety by §G5%§!. Each idea from the innovativeness or plutocracy idea group lowers it by §R5%§!. Each idea from the trade, diplomacy or espionage groups lowers it by §R2.5%§!.\n\nAnother major source of piety is your §Bgovernment§!: theocracies have §G+20%§! piety, tribal governments have §G+10%§!, and republics have §R-10%§!. In addition, earlier forms of government such as feudal or despotic have §G+10%§! piety, while more advanced kinds like constitutional or enlightened have §R-10%§!. Your piety can also be affected by your §Beducation system§!, which is determined by the decisions you take and your administrative technology. Finally, your country's §Bcircumstances§! will affect piety; being at war with a religious enemy raises it, allying with one lowers it, being defender of the faith raises it, as does bordering a heathen country. There are many other modifiers that can affect piety, but most will be shown in the effect of events and decisions. In the end, use your common sense!"
 dg_help.015.t:1 "Church Influence in Dei Gratia"
 dg_help.015.d:1 "Every country has a §Gchurch influence§! rating, which reflects how strong and independent the state church is in your country. Most countries can see their country's church influence on the religion screen, except for Catholics who see the papacy instead (sorry).\n\nChurch Influence is rated from 0 (none) to 100 (total). The higher your church influence, the stronger the church becomes. The higher your church influence, the more §Gmissionaries§! you will receive, the stronger those missionaries will be, and the lower your §Grevolt risk§! will be in provinces with the state religion. On the other hand, your §Radministrative tech costs§! and §Rstability costs§! will be higher, and you will receive much less §Rtax income§! from provinces with the state religion.\n\nLike piety, church influence usually changes gradually. It is calculated behind the scenes two to three times a year, and comes from three major sources: §BProperty and Wealth§! is worth up to 60% influence, representing land owned by the church. Giving land to the church or paying them money will increase this amount, while seizing or taxing it will lower it. §BLegal Authority§! is worth as much as 40%, but is usually much less. This represents the legal power of the church, and comes from having representatives in government (such as advisors), from having independent church courts, and from having a theocratic form of government. Hiring theologians or inquisitors will raise it, while enforcing secular courts will lower it. Finally, §BPopular Appeal§! is worth up to 20% and represents the church's support from the population. This could come from control over the education system or from monasticism."
 dg_help.021.t:1 "The Mechanics of Religious Minorities"
 dg_help.021.d:1 "In Dei Gratia, every province is divided into 21 'populations' which can each have a religion. The mod checks each province's populations behind the scenes every 4 months to decide which religion to assign to the province. Any remaining populations are shown as province modifiers whose effects depend on how much your country tolerates that religion.\n\nAs part of this system, converting a province will not convert the entire population, so a province may revert back to its original religion. Don't lose heart; a close inspection will show you that your state religion has gained followers there!"
 dg_help.022.t:1 "Converting Religious Minorities"
 dg_help.022.d:1 "Unfortunately you cannot send a missionary to a province that already has your state religion. Instead, countries get access to two decisions that allow them to get rid of minorities.\n\nThe §Bpeaceful conversion§! decision allows you to convert a minority in one province. It automatically chooses the province with the largest possible minority to convert, and automatically succeeds, although it takes some time. However, peaceful conversion only reduces the population by 10% (heathen minorities) to 20% (heretic minorities). Because of this, it is not always practical for large empires.\n\nThe §Bforced conversion§! decision allows you to reduce a minority by 10% throughout your empire. This is a much more dangerous decision; a minority that is widespread enough will resist this decree with an uprising or even a civil war! The larger the minority is compared to your state religion, the worse the results will be.\n\nIn both cases, some of your minority will convert to your state religion, and others will choose to pack up and leave, becoming refugees that will seek a home elsewhere."
 dg_help.023.t:1 "Encouraging Religious Minorities"
 dg_help.023.d:1 "Several interesting religions in the game (like Jews, Chaldeans, Shintô or Jains) appear only as religious minorities. An interesting goal could be to revive one of these religions and then play as a country of that faith. But how? When a §Bminority event§! happens, the option that is most tolerant towards the minority can cause it to grow, as can religious rebels. Usually this will not make a minority into the majority, but in a heavily divided province it could make the difference. You could also try to attract refugees to your lands when they are expelled from other countries."
 dg_help.023.a:1 "Tell me about these minority events"
 dg_help.024.t:1 "Events for Religious Minorities"
 dg_help.024.d:1 "Religious minorities in your country also give you access to 4 random events. These events can be used to deliberately increase the population of a minority in your country, if you are so inclined; in every case, tolerating the minority means they will grow by 1 in one province. In some cases, your choices may also prevent you from expelling those minorities for 5-10 years afterwards (because your ruler finds them convenient to have around).\n\nThe §BGifted§! event gives you the option of accepting an advisor or general from that religion.\nThe §BTemple§! event asks you to approve building of a new church, mosque or temple for that minority in a province. You may choose to allow it, deny them, or demand payment for the right.\nThe §BContacts§! event lets you use a minority in your empire which is also found in a centre of trade you are trading in, allowing you to gain a small trade advantage there. Note, however, that some religions are far more likely to be found in centres of trade than others!\nThe §BScapegoats§! event fires when countries are at low stability. It allows countries to blame their problems on a minority of the same culture, regaining stability at the cost of some revolt risk."
 dg_help.031.t:1 "Converting Your Own Country"
 dg_help.031.d:1 "With dozens of religions in the game, it is important to understand how and why you can convert. Most religions do not allow their ruler to convert the country, but there are exceptions. Hindus may convert to Jainism and vice versa, Buddhists may convert freely between their denominations, Sunni and Wahhabi Muslims may convert, and the five western Christian denominations (Catholics, Protestants, Reformed Christians, Calixtines and Gnostic Christians) can convert between each other.\n\nYou may only convert once per ruler, and not under certain circumstances. In addition, the stability cost of converting depends on the circumstances: owning provinces of the desired religion, having a theologian advisor, and having a strong ruler will all make it easier.\n\nIn some cases, you may not be able to convert this way until a religion is enabled by event (for example, it will take several years after the Reformed religion appears before a ruler would willingly convert to it), or you may never be able to convert this way (it is impossible for an Orthodox country to convert to Catholic by this method). In those cases, there are events that can allow a country to convert its religion. For example, Orthodox countries can convert to Catholic once, by decision during a church council. Countries in India may be able to convert to Sikhism by event when it appears. Pagans will receive missionaries that may ask them to convert to the religion of nearby nations. A vassal's overlord can sometimes ask for its conversion. However, these events are rare.\n\nOne final way to convert your religion is by suffering religious rebels. If you have a high tolerance for a religion, then rebels of that religion can force you to convert to it. If you try to force a religion to convert and it starts a War of Religion, you may choose which religion to support, and in so doing, your state religion."
 dg_help.031.a:1 "Tell me more about conversion"
 dg_help.032.t:1 "Converting Other Countries"
 dg_help.032.d:1 "There are only a few ways to convert another country to your religion. During a war, you may be able to ask the other country to convert, but only if it would normally be able to do so voluntarily. In other words, you could force a Catholic country to become Protestant, but not Orthodox. If you convert religion, your vassals who belong to your old religion will be asked to convert as well. You may also demand that a vassal convert to your religion if its capital belongs to your religion - which can be helped along by a decision §Rnot in this version§! to send missionaries. Finally, you will be told about wars of religion in other countries if you have chosen to receive religious news. By intervening on one side, you will control the outcome - and the religion of the country."
 dg_help.033.t:1 "Converting Provinces for Once and for All"
 dg_help.033.d:1 "When a missionary succeeds in converting a province, it does not always stay converted. Why? Because missionaries in Dei Gratia can only convert a fraction of the population.\n\nJust as every country has a state religion but may own provinces of many religions, each province has a religion on the map, but may have populations belonging to several faiths. In Dei Gratia, every province is divided into 21 populations which each have a religion. The mod checks each province's populations two to three times a year to decide which religion to assign to it.\n\nWhen a missionary succeeds in a province, it converts the province to the state religion, which is a signal to the mod that up to 20% of the heathens and 20% of the heretics in that province will convert to your state religion. Sometimes this is enough to convert a province with one missionary - if you had a minority there already, or if the province was divided between many religions. Sometimes it may take two or even three missionaries before the province converts for good.\n\nThese early missionaries are not wasted. Every time a missionary succeeds, your religion grows in that province (check the minority modifiers!). In addition, you will be rewarded with prestige (and papal influence for Catholics) every time a missionary succeeds, whether or not it is 'final'.\n\nWhen your religion is the single biggest faith in the province, the province will stay your religion - but be aware that this often leaves behind minorities of other faiths. These minorities may be a thorn in your side - or they may be safely ignored. Which is true will depend on your tolerance and your strategy."

However, it is not all glory: the title is a weighty crown that comes with grave responsibilities. Some nations of the past have chosen to purify themselves and shine as a beacon in the night as a perfect example of their faith for others.

 charity_schools_title:1 "§G†§! Establish Charity Schools"
 charity_schools_desc:1 "The church ran most charity in the middle ages, including hospitals, orphanages and schools. It was only natural that the church began to establish free schools for orphans, then for poor children of all sorts. In some cases the state would help this process along by mandating the schools, making a basic level of education significantly more widespread."
 church_taxes_title:1 "§G†§! Tax church property"
 church_taxes_desc:1 "By long tradition, the state supported the church by not taxing it. As modern tax codes developed, this exception was increasingly obvious to rulers who noted how much of the nation's land was owned directly by the church without actually being houses of worship. Clergy increasingly ran farms, businesses, or even acted as landlords of tenant farmers, all without paying taxes to the state. By removing this exception, we can increase the coffers of the state without raising taxes on the peasants or risking a revolt from the aristocracy. However, it will harm the church's finances, and this may cut back on their missionary and charitable work."
 donate_land_to_church_title:1 "§G†§! Donate state lands to the church"
 donate_land_to_church_desc:1 "The clergy not only lead services, they also train missionaries, run soup kitchens, orphanages, schools, hospices and hospitals. All this costs money. One way to encourage the church and its missionary work would be to donate state land to it. This would allow the church to expand its operations and bring us back into their good graces, although it would take more lands out of taxation."
 edict_of_tolerance_title:1 "§G†§! Promulgate an Edict of Tolerance"
 edict_of_tolerance_desc:1 "Our nation is split between heresy and the true faith. Converting the heretics back to the true faith would be ideal but costly. Another option could be to promise the heretics some freedom to practise their religion in peace within certain areas and limits. Such an edict would not be popular, but it would bring us peace at a time when we could use it."
 endow_churches_title:1 "§G†§! Make a generous donation"
 endow_churches_desc:1 "In an age when a ruler's legitimacy was defined as his ability to defend the faith, a ruler could establish his authority and wealth by devoting his wealth to the state religion. By renovating buildings, endowing charities and commissioning religious art, a ruler established himself as a pious and powerful man."
 foreign_missionary_neighbor_title:1 "§G†§! Send missionaries to our neighbours"
 foreign_missionary_neighbor_desc:1 "One of our neighbours has yet to see the light and embrace the true faith. We should consider sending a group of missionaries to a nearby province to try and convert their people to our faith. Doing so could help sway their ruler to join our cause if he is wavering in his support for his misguided religion, or it could help give us a casus belli if a large number of people convert to our religion, or it could simply increase tensions between our countries. We should consider carefully whether this is a good idea, especially since concentrating our efforts in this way may hurt our missionary efforts at home.\n\nOn average, a missionary sent in this way will convert 20% of the target province. The owner of the province will have the opportunity to react to this decision."
 foreign_missionary_primitive_title:1 "§G†§! Send missionaries to convert the primitives"
 foreign_missionary_primitive_desc:1 "Our missionaries are eager to spread the true faith to the pagans! They seek government support for a mission abroad in which they will approach the ruler of a primitive nation and attempt to convert him to the true faith. This is a laudable goal and could help create a staunch ally in the region if it pays off. However, it may take repeated visits to sway rulers who stubbornly cling to their false gods."
 foreign_missionary_vassal_title:1 "§G†§! Send missionaries to our subjects"
 foreign_missionary_vassal_desc:1 "One of our subjects has yet to see the light and embrace the true faith. We should consider sending a group of missionaries to their court to try and convert their ruler to our faith, or at least make a start in showing them the right path. This may upset them, however: they may decide to declare war for independence if they cannot stomach our religion."
 head_of_church_title:1 "§G†§! Act of Supremacy"
 head_of_church_desc:1 "At times, the church and state had a rocky relationship. Religious leaders could criticise the ruler on moral grounds or try to influence government policy. Worse yet, they could often call upon support from the population. To avoid this challenge to their authority, rulers could legally establish themselves as the head of the state church, giving them the same powers as the leader of a religious order. This would give them the authority to appoint religious leaders they preferred, seize church land, and be the final arbiter in issues of doctrine or law. This was an extremely unpopular decision with the church, but in most cases, they had little choice but to accept the new reality."
 holy_land_balga_title:1 "Recover Ostpreussen for the true faith"
 holy_land_balga_desc:1 "According to legend, the temple of Romuva was once found in a town called Balga, in the modern day province of Ostpreussen. There, the high priest Brutenis announced the commandments of the gods, established orders of priests and virgin priestesses, and built a temple to the gods within a giant oak tree. It was said to have been the centre of worship in Old Prussia until its conquest by crusaders in 1239. We should recover it for the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith!"
 intermarriage_title:1 "Send a marriage proposal"
 intermarriage_desc:1 "One of our neighbours would be an excellent choice to tie our ruling families together, were it not for our misgivings at their heathen beliefs. We could overlook their alien faith and send them a proposal anyway, but this runs the risk of them rejecting our proposal.\n\nIf more than one country could be eligible for this decision, it will choose the one you have the highest opinion of."
 monastic_schools_title:1 "§G†§! Establish Monastic Schools"
 monastic_schools_desc:1 "The first universities were established during the middle ages. Most grew naturally out of smaller schools run by monks of a monastery. Because they represented a body of literate scholars, it was the natural location for nearby nobles to send their children to receive a basic education. At the same time, they also learned a deeper understanding of their faith."
 oath_of_loyalty_title:1 "§G†§! Force clergy to swear loyalty"
 oath_of_loyalty_desc:1 "Although the ruler had the right to appoint religious leaders, this was not always effective - once appointed, religious leaders did not always remain loyal to their patron. In response to this, the government could require all members of the clergy to swear an oath of loyalty - not to their god or their church, but to the state. This would not only reduce the likelihood of them criticising the government, it would also give the ruler a legal right to remove them from office when they did so. However, it would be extremely unpopular with the clergy, let alone foreign religious leaders."
 organized_religion_clerical_requirements_title:1 "§G†§! Establish a formal priesthood"
 organized_religion_clerical_requirements_desc:1 "Our nation is modern but our faith is still primitive. Our state religion is decentralised, which means the state has relatively little control over it compared to our more organised neighbours. In order to reform our religion, first we must have an official priesthood - one which has established rules, duties and abilities that separate them from the common worshipper."
 organized_religion_legal_reforms_title:1 "§G†§! Establish religious laws"
 organized_religion_legal_reforms_desc:1 "Now that we have established a written set of scriptures it is easy to see how divine commandments could be codified and established into law. Normally our people resist changing the laws, but they are a pious people who respect the gods, so they will accept whatever changes we introduce as long as we have the backing of the heavens.\n\nChoosing this decision will also grant priests in our nation legal independence."
 organized_religion_standardized_credo_title:1 "§G†§! Establish a unified creed"
 organized_religion_standardized_credo_desc:1 "Now that our religion has a single set of sacred stories, it is easier to define what is correct and what is heresy. By having our religious leaders meet and define a list of beliefs that all worshippers must adhere to, we can strengthen our faith and get rid of heresy that might otherwise weaken the state."
 organized_religion_universal_creed_title:1 "§G†§! Adopt a universal religion"
 organized_religion_universal_creed_desc:1 "Our religion is the religion of our people - yet why must we limit ourselves to that definition? Our gods are great, their stories universal truth. If we accept the idea that our religion is true and we will be saved through worship of the gods, then we must recognise our duty to spread our religion to all the peoples of this Earth - an inspiring message indeed."
 organized_religion_written_scripture_title:1 "§G†§! Establish written scripture"
 organized_religion_written_scripture_desc:1 "Part of the problem with our state religion is that it has been passed down orally through generations, leading us to have many different versions of sacred stories. This makes it difficult to decide who is speaking heresy - a useful tool for any ruler! Now that we have an official hierarchy of priests, we should get them to agree on a unified version, which shall be written down for future generations to use."
 policy_of_intolerance_title:1 "§G†§! Persecute other religions"
 policy_of_intolerance_desc:1 "Rulers held considerable influence over the religions in their nation. Whether a religion was persecuted, ignored, tolerated or favoured depended heavily on the policies that the ruler pursued - and could change at any moment. Blaming the problems of a nation on heretics and heathens was a popular tactic used by many rulers to shore up support, but it could lead to resentment from minorities and moderates."
 policy_of_tolerance_title:1 "§G†§! Pursue religious tolerance"
 policy_of_tolerance_desc:1 "Rulers held considerable influence over the religions in their nation. Whether a religion was persecuted, ignored, tolerated or favoured depended heavily on the policies that the ruler pursued - and could change at any moment. For a ruler to tolerate heretics and heathens, it meant fighting against the prejudices of religious leaders and peasants, but it could pay off by having stability and loyalty from minorities."
 preparatory_schools_title:1 "§G†§! Establish Preparatory Schools"
 preparatory_schools_desc:1 "With the Enlightenment, new ideas about education arose, and with them, new roles for the nobility. In order for aristocrats to succeed at court, they now needed to be skilled in a number of areas, from horsemanship to manners, mathematics to poetry, history to music. Before attending university, the children of the nobility could be sent to boarding schools meant to prepare them for their future careers. Such preparatory schools were also open to the sons of the bourgeoisie, and this spread literacy and allowed some social mobility."
 public_religious_schools_title:1 "§G†§! Establish a Religious school system"
 public_religious_schools_desc:1 "Most schools and colleges were organised by the clergy, in the hopes that establishing literacy among the population would help bring them closer to God. This meant that the church was already well placed to run a public school system, and many early school systems were explicitly operated by the church. This encouraged the population to follow the state religion, although it had little toleration of heresy."
 public_schools_title:1 "§G†§! Establish a Public school system"
 public_schools_desc:1 "As the value of education increased, the state began to seek more control over the education system. Eventually, a system of compulsory education for all children was proposed, giving them some basic literacy and math and providing them with the skills needed to seek a trade. This had the effect of allowing the state to dictate morality to the population, encouraging the growth of nationalism."
 request_clerical_advisor_title:1 "§G†§! Summon a religious advisor"
 request_clerical_advisor_desc:1 "We can ask the head of our religion to send us a man of talent to our court. He will obey us, but will not be happy to give up one of his best and brightest."
 restore_decaying_temples_title:1 "§G†§! Restore decaying temples"
 restore_decaying_temples_desc:1 "Our governors report that some of the religious centres in our nation are sadly neglected. Religious buildings were some of the most visible symbols of a country's power, so having them lay abandoned does our nation no credit. Some among our nation would like to restore them at state expense."

 revoke_blasphemy_laws_desc:1 "Having blasphemy be a criminal offence means the state polices the faith of its subjects, and also means that scholars fear for their freedom should they publish ideas that stray from the teachings of the state religion. Some among our government believe we should return the enforcing of orthodoxy to the church and revoke the laws against blasphemy in our country."

 royal_schools_title:1 "§G†§! Establish an Aristocratic Academy"
 royal_schools_desc:1 "Since the middle ages, strong nobles kept the children of their rivals, educating them at court along with their own children in order to build future alliances and hold a hostage to ensure their parents good behaviour. In later centuries, powerful rulers turned this practise into a system in which the sons of the most powerful families would be taught in a school alongside the heir to the throne. This would encourage friendships among the future movers and shakers of the nation as well as allow for the best tutors to be brought together to teach history, strategy and the art of statecraft."
 seize_church_lands_title:1 "§G†§! Appropriate church property"
 seize_church_lands_desc:1 "Over the centuries, even churches that emphasised poverty became large landowners, as land that was donated stayed in their hands. Worse, in most countries, church land was not taxed, diverting a large part of the country's riches away from the state coffers. More than one ruler looked at the wealth and land of the church with greed in his eyes, but seizing it was easier said than done. With power both spiritual and temporal, it was unwise to cross the church openly. Rulers could, and did, attempt to seize church land, often by phrasing it as a request to the church in order to use the funds to fight a desperate holy war. In times of great hardship, the church might just give in - or be forced to."

 state_supported_church_desc:1 "With the ruler the head of the church, it was only a small step towards the idea that the church should be an arm of the government. Some among our advisors suggest that we should take that step and mandate a tithe on all our subjects which would be paid to the government, which in turn would pay the salaries of clergy, funding for charitable causes, and the upkeep of religious buildings across the nation. This would strengthen the ability of the government to fight heresy, but would require a regular budget."

 desc_crusader_state_without_crusade:1 "Our nation is built upon the idea of a permanent crusade against the heathens. By being the bulwark against the infidel we attracted volunteer crusaders from far and wide to our lands and received financial aid in the form of tithes and wills. Without a heathen enemy to fight, our raison d'etre is at an end - and so are our volunteers. We shall have to make do without their aid."

 desc_cultural_tensions:1 "Although nationalism was an idea in the future, cultural and linguistic differences were not unimportant.

As succeeding generations were raised in their new country, these differences faded away, but until then it could lead to prejudice and conflict."

 desc_monastic_schools:1 "At a time when the government did not run schools, the church was the sole provider of education.

 desc_organized_religion_clerical_requirements:1 "A religion in which every man can perform the rituals of his faith is one in which the state is weak. By creating a hierarchy of priests with our ruler at the top, we will gain more control over how our religion is practised and understood. Under the new system, acolytes will need training, vows and official permission to become a priest and perform rituals, which will strengthen the power of the high priest and reduce the influence of witches and shamans."

By gathering our most respected religious leaders, we can define once and for all what it means to practise our religion. More importantly, this creed will let us define heresy and so embrace a unified vision of faith for the empire."
 organized_religion_universal_creed:1 "Universal Creed"
 desc_organized_religion_universal_creed:1 "Our ancestors worshipped different gods than our neighbours, and we accepted this as the way it should be.

 organized_religion_written_scripture:1 "Written Scripture"
 desc_organized_religion_written_scripture:1 "When religious stories are passed down orally, it lends itself easily to change - and to heresy. A written scripture is unchanging and eternal.

As a result, we are forced to rely upon untrained peasants to fill the ranks.

Increasingly, they are spreading heresy and discouraging the faithful."

 desc_preparatory_schools:1 "Preparatory schools were set up as boarding schools for the children of the elite in which they could be trained in statecraft under the watchful eye of their ruler.

 succession_problems_obstacle:1 "\nThe traditions of [Root.GetName] meant that no single dynasty could claim a right to the throne. Instead, there were dozens of precedents for an influential advisor or successful general to take the throne from a weak or untested [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Knowing this, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] saw successful leaders as rivals for power and often eliminated them, weakening the state and forcing confrontations such as these. To end this cycle would require dramatic reforms to society. (Remove the obstacle by decision)"
 succession_problems_polygamy:1 "\nHaving multiple wives meant never having a problem finding an heir - the problem was having too many. Since Muslims did not automatically have primogeniture laws, any son could inherit his father's throne. Some were willing to seize it from a brother if they saw the opportunity, or if they were backed up by an ambitious noble or foreign prince. In later years, more advanced thinkers proposed drastic measures to avoid this problem: having the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have all [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] brothers strangled to avoid them rising up against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. (Increase your administrative tech level to avoid this in the future)"
 succession_problems_tribal:1 "\nTribes were particularly prone to succession crises, since they did not have clear succession laws. A strong ruler could secure his rule by gathering support, but a weak one invited rivals to attack.
