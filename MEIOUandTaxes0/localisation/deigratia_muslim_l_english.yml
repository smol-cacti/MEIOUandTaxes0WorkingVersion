 dg_islam.002.t:1 "Sharia Law"
 dg_islam.002.d:1 "All Islamic countries based their laws on Shari'a to one degree or another. Shari'a was a set of laws as laid out in the Qur'an and the Sunnah, interpreted by the Ulema when new situations arose not covered in them. In addition to criminal and civil laws, Shari'a includes laws that dictate religious and personal obligations, making them not just theologically important, but actually illegal to violate.\n\nNot every Muslim ruler enforced Shari'a equally, but doing so - and gaining the support of the Ulema - was an important part of the legitimacy of a $MONARCHTITLE$. On the other hand, tribal laws sometimes conflicted with Shari'a, and rulers who could dictate new laws had an advantage over those who could not."
 dg_islam.002.a:1 "Enforce Shari'a law strictly"
 dg_islam.002.b:1 "State law exists only to complement religious law"
 dg_islam.002.c:1 "The government has the sole power to introduce laws"
 dg_islam.003.t:1 "The Condemnation of the Ulema"
 dg_islam.003.d:1 "Ulema are religious scholars who practise Islamic law. The title is only granted to those clergy who have completed many years of study, making the Ulema greatly respected in the Islamic world. With this prestige comes grave responsibilities: Ulema are expected to act as judges, advisors and teachers, giving them an authority to rival the $MONARCHTITLE$. At times when they felt the state had gone astray, they could openly criticise it in sermons. With no central authority in Islam, there were always a few Ulema willing to speak against secular authorities."
 dg_islam.003.a:1 "Suffer this criticism but change nothing"
 dg_islam.003.b:1 "Accept their reproof and ask them for counsel"
 dg_islam.003.c:1 "Stand firm and confront their authority"
 dg_islam.004.t:1 "The Blessings of the Ulema"
 dg_islam.004.d:1 "Ulema are religious scholars who practise Islamic law. The title is only granted to those clergy who have completed many years of study, making the Ulema greatly respected in the Islamic world. With this prestige comes grave responsibilities: Ulema are expected to act as judges, advisors and teachers, giving them an authority to rival the $MONARCHTITLE$. When they expressed their satisfaction with the laws of $COUNTRY$, it gave $MONARCH$ extra authority."
 dg_islam.004.a:1 "Reward them for their support"
 dg_islam.004.b:1 "Accept their approval as our due"
 dg_islam.007.t:1 "Islamic Trusts"
 dg_islam.007.d:1 "The practise of expropriating the property of disgraced or dead officials led to many wealthy Muslims declaring their property 'waqf', a religious endowment. The income from these properties would go toward the upkeep of mosques, orphanages or hospitals. Since there was no single religious authority in Islam, donors could declare their own descendants to be the trustees of their property, effectively keeping it within the family and ensuring they would continue to be supported. This practise not only created vast tax-free holdings in these trusts, but it was also of dubious legality! Not all Ulema agreed on whether it should be allowed, leaving it within the purview of the monarch to decide."
 dg_islam.007.a:1 "They are essential to the functioning of the church"
 dg_islam.007.c:1 "Ban the practise and seize the trust"
 dg_islam.008.t:1 "Translation of the Qur'an"
 dg_islam.008.d:1 "It has come to our attention that a local printer has decided to publish a translation of the Qu'ran, the book written by the heathen prophet of the Mohammedans. Although it is a holy book to their kind, it is blasphemy to the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith - in it, Jesus Christ is described as a prophet, not the son of God! Many people have begun demanding that we shut down the printer. Others are curious about what else it might reveal about the heathens."
 dg_islam.008.a:1 "Ban the book and fine the printers"
 dg_islam.008.b:1 "Let the people read it"
 dg_islam.008.c:1 "It is irrelevant to us"
 dg_islam.008.e:1 "Study its errors to use against the heathens"
 dg_islam.010.t:1 "Ghazi Warriors"
 dg_islam.010.d:1 "Since the days of the Prophet, Muslims had raided neighbouring lands, eventually bringing them under Muslim rule. This raiding was seen both as a holy mission to expand Islam and a way to gain wealth for raiders. Young men who had few prospects often declared themselves Ghazi, or holy warriors, and left to seek out glorious battle, often journeying long distances to the frontiers of Islam. This could come as a relief to their countrymen, for the ghazi were not above raiding fellow Muslims when there were no infidels to plunder."
 dg_islam.010.a:1 "Send them to the frontier"
 dg_islam.010.b:1 "Forbid them from going"
 dg_islam.011.t:1 "Jihad!"
 dg_islam.011.d:1 "Holy warriors have arrived from across the Muslim world to join our war against the infidel! Since the days of the Prophet, Muslims had raided neighbouring lands, eventually bringing them under Muslim rule. This raiding was seen both as a holy mission to expand Islam and a way to gain wealth for raiders. Young men who had few prospects often declared themselves Ghazi, or holy warriors, and left to seek out glorious battle, often journeying long distances to the frontiers of Islam. There they experienced mixed welcomes - on one hand, they were allies, but on the other hand, they were often foreigners who were not under the command of the $MONARCHTITLE$, and as fanatics they could get upset at what they saw as decadence and disrespect in the land they had come to save."
 dg_islam.011.a:1 "Our ranks are swelling"
 dg_islam.013.t:1 "Muslim Merchants"
 dg_islam.013.d:1 "In many parts of the world Islam spread peacefully by contact with Muslim merchants who founded small communities there. Islam spread as a result of these commercial contacts and political rivalries. Local elites interested in trade, state formation or gaining legitimacy adopted Islam eagerly. Acceptance of Islam by local merchant princes won them social and administrative support and entry into the extensive Muslim trading networks in India, Arabia and China. Those who chose instead to cut off trade with them soon found themselves isolated and unable to compete with nations who had access to the Muslim world."
 dg_islam.013.a:1 "Allow them to live in our lands"
 dg_islam.013.b:1 "Close our ports to their ships"
 dg_islam.014.t:1 "Sufi Missionaries"
 dg_islam.014.d:1 "In many parts of the world Islam spread peacefully by contact with Muslim missionaries who founded small communities there. Sufi mystics and village teachers settled widely, helping to educate the masses and establishing new settlements that were peaceful and loyal. The Sufis were especially effective at converting locals because their enthusiastic, populist ways of expressing their faith through dance, displays of magical power and song was more palatable to heathens whose view of Islam was strict and foreign. Through their efforts, Islam became part of $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ culture and identity until the borders between Islam and $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ became blurred."
 dg_islam.014.a:1 "Allow them to preach in our nation"
 dg_islam.014.b:1 "Persecute converts and ban them from proselyting"
 dg_islam.015.t:1 "Muslim Elites Emerge in $COUNTRY$"
 dg_islam.015.d:1 "As Islam spread in $COUNTRY$ it became an important stakeholder in society, and now some of our ruling elite has openly converted to the foreign faith. With a rich, educated elite embracing the faith, local potentates interested in gaining legitimacy or in state formation looked to the Muslims to provide support. This inevitably brought them into conflict with other rulers, which in turn helped to spread Islam when the nascent Muslim states won victory."
 dg_islam.015.a:1 "Turn a blind eye to their blasphemy"
 dg_islam.015.b:1 "This is too much! Wipe them out to the last!"
 dg_islam.015.c:1 "I see the way the wind is blowing"
 dg_islam.016.t:1 "Muslim Resistance"
 dg_islam.016.d:1 "The governor of $PROVINCENAME$ reports a large number of conversions to Islam recently. Dissatisfied locals looking for a way to unify $PROVINCECULTURE$ people against foreign rule often saw Islam as a solution. Islam accepted all people, and already had a foothold in $PROVINCECAPITAL$. By abandoning their original faith they could also abandon tribal loyalties and develop a new identity which would develop into a kind of nationalism."
 dg_islam.016.a:1 "We will keep a watchful eye on the situation"
 dg_islam.027.t:1 "Muslim Castes"
 dg_islam.027.d:1 "Although Muslims came to India with hopes of converting the locals to Islam, they adopted some Indian customs in return. One of the most pervasive was the caste system. Islam preached egalitarianism, but even in the Middle East there were class distinctions. In India, with its entrenched caste system, Muslim castes became even more pronounced. The highest Noble castes, or 'Ashraf', included foreign-born Muslims and noble Hindus who had converted to Islam. This was followed by the Wretched 'Ajlaf' castes which included most of the population in different sub-castes. At the very bottom were the lowest of all, the 'Arzal' who were forbidden from entering mosques or using public burial grounds. Imams often preached against these castes, but they helped integrate the Muslim conquerors into Hindu society and so proved remarkably resilient."
 dg_islam.027.a:1 "It is a useful and harmless custom"
 dg_islam.027.b:1 "Discourage the practise"
 dg_islam.028.t:1 "The Divine Religion"
 dg_islam.028.d:1 "Everyone agrees that $MONARCH$ is a wise and noble $MONARCHTITLE$, who debates theology and philosophy with great men from across the known world. Of special interest to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] is the faith of $RULER_ADJ$ subjects, so many of whom are heathens. After years of investigation, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ has concluded that no religion has a monopoly on the truth - not even the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith. Going back to $RULER_ADJ$ roots, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ has created a new religion that takes the best elements of Islam and other $COUNTRY_ADJ$ faiths: Din i-Ilahi, the Divine Faith.\n\nAlready the Ulama and Sufis are declaring this to be blasphemy, but who can gainsay the $MONARCHTITLE$?"
 dg_islam.028.a:1 "Adopt the Divine Religion"
 dg_islam.028.b:1 "Smother the $MONARCHTITLE$ in $RULER_ADJ$ sleep"
 dg_islam.031.t:1 "The Treasure Fleets Visit $COUNTRY$"
 dg_islam.031.d:1 "During the early fifteenth century China reversed its course of introspection and sent an expedition to the rest of the world. The fleet was unimaginably massive: hundreds of ships, some larger than any seen ever before, with tens of thousands of crew and soldiers to show the might of China.\n\nStopping at ports across the Indian Ocean, the Chinese presented gifts of gold, silver, porcelain and silk to the $MONARCHTITLE$, recognising [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as the rightful governor of $COUNTRY$ - and a loyal vassal of the faraway Chinese empire. In return, they expected tribute from $COUNTRY$ to acknowledge this relationship.\n\nThe fleet was not afraid to meddle in local politics, destroying pirates it ran into and once capturing a local king who dared reject the mission. In its wake, it left thriving communities of Chinese and Arab traders."
 dg_islam.031.a:1 "Send an envoy to the emperor promising obedience"
 dg_islam.031.b:1 "Accept their gifts and give them tokens of submission"
 dg_islam.031.c:1 "Send the army to turn them away"
 dg_islam.032.t:1 "Political Islamification"
 dg_islam.032.d:1 "Islam often spread through trade, or as merchants married into local families. At other times it spread through missionaries. Sometimes, however, conversion to Islam was a calculated decision. Islam offered rulers a means to override tradition and centralise power - and it offered vassals justification for revolt against heathen overlords. When put that way, it is not surprising that many vassal lords eagerly embraced the foreign religion."
 dg_islam.032.a:1 "Allow local lords to convert"
 dg_islam.032.b:1 "Imprison local lords who convert"
 dg_islam.032.c:1 "Embrace this foreign religion"
 dg_islam.032.e:1 "Stay true to our masters"
 dg_islam.041.t:1 "Sufi Mystics"
 dg_islam.041.d:1 "One of the more unique expressions of faith in Islam was Sufiism. Sufis are holy orders of Muslims who regarded Islam as having become too worldly and intellectual. In opposition to the legalistic theology of the Ulema, Sufis emphasised a personal relationship with Allah expressed through music, poetry, dance, strict poverty and acts of devotion.\n\nBy the twelfth century there were many different orders of Sufis, or 'Tariqa', each of which could trace its lineage back to a sheikh who had been taught by the Prophet himself. Sufi Sheikhs were said to see the future, cure the sick, and intercede with Allah for worshippers. They gathered disciples to them who were sworn to absolute obedience. Each tariqa varied in their aims, activities and whether they followed Shi'a or Sunni Islam, but all tended to fall into two broad groups.\n\n'Sober' Sufis saw Allah as aloof from humans and so emphasised awe of God and a rigid adherence to His laws. §GReform Sufis§!, who sought out corruption within Islam and heresy without, and §GShari'a Sufis§!, who sought to teach theology, are examples of Sober Sufis. In contrast, 'Ecstatic' or 'Drunken' Sufis were said to be intoxicated by the nearness of Allah's love, and emphasised an emotional connection to God. §GShrine Sufis§! showed this connection through missionary work, music, pilgrimage and jihads. Fakirs would travel around the countryside, begging for alms and performing miracles. Occasionally, a Fakir would found a Sufi order based on his personal charisma, but Sufis also worked with local leaders."

Their devotion to the cause was admirable, but not always in tune with the aims of the state - but a wise $MONARCHTITLE$ could find uses for Sufi orders. A particularly popular one is emerging in $PROVINCENAME$ - a 'sober' Sufi order dedicated to reforming the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith.

 dg_islam.046.t:1 "Sufi Shrine Founded in $PROVINCENAME$"
 dg_islam.046.d:1 "A charismatic Sufi could attract a large following, and upon his death, his followers sometimes established a mausoleum or shrine in his honour. Such places attracted pious worshippers - at first, among the Sufis, but soon becoming part of popular religion as commoners began to make pilgrimages in order to pray or serve penance. This kind of Sufi shrine helped to establish a Sufi order in a place, which could be good or bad, depending on the order."

 dg_islam.047.t:1 "Madrassa Founded in $PROVINCENAME$"
 dg_islam.047.d:1 "Beginning in the medieval era some Muslim countries began building §Wmadrassas§! (schools) to teach the Qur'an, history, law, logic and Arabic. These schools were usually funded through special trusts (waqf) set up by wealthy Muslims or by Sufi orders who operated them and provided a formal education to those lucky enough to attend. For rulers, endowing a madrassa could be a means of showing their generosity and piety."

 dg_islam.048.t:1 "Sufi Converts"
 dg_islam.048.d:1 "Many heathens in [Root.Capital.GetName] have been converted to Islam by Sufi Dervishes living nearby. This kind of voluntary conversion was treasured by ordinary Muslims and shared in stories, but there is something worrying about this new community.\n\nDervishes are holy men who spend their time in devotion to Allah through dance, poetry, fasting and prayer. The Fakir mystics who lead them are said to dress in rags or animal skins, going from place to place begging and performing miracles, gathering followers before settling down and establishing Akhts to provide hospices for pilgrims and travellers. Their followers included Christians, Jews and other heathens who saw divinity in the Fakirs. Many such followers converted to Islam, but they often brought some of their beliefs into the Orders they joined. Sufi Orders were known to adopt baptism, the use of wine and bread in sacraments, anointing with ointment, and the adoration of gods and saints such as Khidr Ilyas (Saint George) or Eflatun (Plato). With so many things borrowed from other faiths, it should come as no surprise that such groups were sometimes accused of heresy."
 dg_islam.048.a:1 "Celebrate this miracle"
 dg_islam.048.b:1 "Accuse them of heresy"
 dg_islam.049.t:1 "Sufi Ribat"
 dg_islam.049.d:1 "Sufi mystics were naturally attracted to the frontiers of Islam, where they set up hostels and forts known as ribats. These settlements served as gathering places for Sufis, a place where they could pray, conduct missionary work, and teach the tenets of their order to trainees. In times of war, these forts also served as useful sources of soldiers along the frontier, and in peace time, merchants found them useful as waypoints for caravans. However, the ribats were supported by donations from wealthy citizens that might otherwise enrich the state, and their existence gave power to the Sufi orders, which was not always in tune with the goals of the $MONARCHTITLE$."
 dg_islam.049.a:1 "Allow this settlement"
 dg_islam.049.b:1 "Demand they dismantle the fort"
 dg_islam.050.t:1 "Dervish Warriors"
 dg_islam.050.d:1 "Sufi mystics devoted themselves to Allah in many ways. One popular way was to declare themselves Ghazi and fight in a holy war against Islam's enemies. When a pious Muslim ruler faced heretics and heathens, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ sometimes found support from Sufi orders who attached themselves to $RULER_ADJ$ armies."
 dg_islam.050.a:1 "Praise to Allah!"
 dg_islam.051.t:1 "Charismatic Revolt"
 dg_islam.051.d:1 "Declaring that $MONARCH$ has become decadent and immoral, a charismatic Sufi leader has raised his banner in revolt, bringing with him thousands of fanatical Sufi dervishes. Before our forces could react, his men launched surprise attacks on towns, temples and fortresses, burning mosques and converting people forcefully to his heretic religion."
 dg_islam.051.a:1 "We must stamp this out or risk losing the whole region!"
 dg_islam.052.t:1 "Charges of Innovation"
 dg_islam.052.d:1 "An issue has arisen which is dividing the Ulema. Some are levelling charges of innovation against the state.\n\nAfter the death of Muhammad (peace be upon him) questions arose that were not covered in the Qur'an. By the tenth century, however, most Ulema agreed that these issues had been resolved and added to Shari'a law. Consequently there would be no new rules added to Shari'a - the gates of ijtihad were now closed, and Islam would henceforth be defined by its adherence to tradition."
 dg_islam.052.a:1 "Return to tradition"
 dg_islam.052.b:1 "Find an Ulema who will allow this novelty"
 dg_islam.052.c:1 "Ignore the controversy"
 dg_islam.052.d_2:1 "\nNew concepts and technologies continued to arise, causing problems for the Ulema. Coffee, tobacco, firearms, even new forms of music or dance were all absent from Shari'a and consequently controversial. It was nearly inevitable that some Ulema would condemn them in the strongest possible terms: innovation. In the words of the prophet: 'The worst things are those that are novelties. Every novelty is an innovation, every innovation is an error, and every error leads to Hellfire.'"
 dg_islam.052.d_shia:1 "\nThis was somewhat less of an issue in Shi'a Islam, which allowed for its Ulema to exercise ijtihad and add new laws, but it still caused friction when new ideas arose that were not covered in Shari'a law."
 dg_islam.053.t:1 "Sufi-Ulema Rivalry"
 dg_islam.053.d:1 "Sufiism and Islamic jurisprudence represented two opposing views of Islam. On the one side, the Ulema interpreted Islamic law, using it as a basis to understand and solve life's problems. On the other side, Sufis approached Allah from a personal and emotional perspective, devoting themselves entirely to God through chanting, singing, teaching, missionary work and jihad. The Ulema often spoke out against the dangers of Sufiism, especially the potential for heresy and idolatry. The Sufis, in turn, often decried the dry theology of the Ulema, encouraging people to abandon it and take up a life of personal devotion instead. Sometimes the two lived side by side peacefully, and sometimes one became ascendant over the other, but at other times, the rivalry between the two threatened to spill over into a serious conflict. At times like these, it behoved the $MONARCHTITLE$ to intervene in order to bring unity back to the nation."

 dg_islam.053.c:1 "Stay removed from this conflict"
 dg_islam.054.t:1 "Ulema Preach Compassion and Tolerance"
 dg_islam.054.d:1 "Ulema jurists and scholars were interpreters of Islamic law. Like the Christian bible, the Muslim Qur'an devoted many verses to the subjects of compassion, tolerance and love of sinners. For example, it was prohibited for Muslims to convert someone to their faith forcefully. Also like Christians, many Muslim states ignored these prescriptions when they were inconvenient. The Ulema saw it as their duty to remind rulers of their obligation to follow the laws of the Qur'an and live with heretics and heathens peacefully - whether they liked it or not."

 dg_islam.055.t:1 "Sufis Preach Against Heresy and Corruption"
 dg_islam.055.d:1 "Sufi Sheikhs and Mullahs were quick to point out when $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ society had lost its way. Tolerating idolaters and heretics, concentrating too much on wealth and not enough on God, or turning a blind eye to casual sin were all common complaints. When a charismatic leader spoke out against the $MONARCHTITLE$, it was time to take action. One option was to crack down on sin and liberalism, and another was to take action against critics."

 dg_islam.061.d:1 "In $YEAR$ a new Caliph arose in [From.GetName], demanding that all Muslims recognise his authority.\n\nIn Islam, the Khalifa is literally the 'successor' of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and therefore the spiritual leader of the Dar al Islam, the Islamic world. Originally it was a powerful office, with all Muslims living under the rule of a Caliph who was both spiritual and temporal leader. As time went on and Islam expanded into new regions, sultans and emirs established their independence, new dynasties supplanted old ones, and the Ulema reasserted their authority over scripture. The impotence of the Caliphs was shown shockingly with the sack of Baghdad in 1258. After that, the line of Caliphs continued, but their authority had become a polite fiction outside the country that they lived in. Nevertheless, the dream of uniting all Islam into a single empire was one that many rulers would be happy to claim. When a new Caliph arose, the states around it paid attention."

In practise, the Caliph had little authority beyond $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ lands and Muslim rulers were completely independent of him.\n\nHowever, theory can have its applications! The ruler of [From.GetName] has sent a delegation to $CAPITAL_CITY$ bearing gifts for the Caliph. They humbly request that the Caliph grant their ruler investiture over the lands he already controls - in effect recognising his rule as legitimate. Doing so would also benefit us, as it would recognise the authority of the Caliph. However, granting the Caliph's authority to a bad ruler could cause Muslims to believe him corrupt."

However, according to most traditions the Prophet did not leave behind instructions on how to choose a successor. At first the whole Muslim population elected the Caliph, but as Islam spread this became unwieldy and the Ulema debated how to choose a successor. Over the generations, they gravitated toward having fewer and fewer electors, and finally decided that it should be divinely appointed by having the Caliph should choose his own successor from his sons.

Every Muslim who could read knew that the Kaaba was destined to be destroyed, for it was written in the Quran that it would be destroyed by an Abyssinian as one of the last signs before the Day of Resurrection. Already Mullahs have begun preaching that the end of the world is nigh!\n\nThere is a problem with this statement, however: it means that the other signs must have already happened - including that the souls of the faithful will be taken up into Paradise, leaving only the corrupt and impure on Earth. Muslims worldwide are becoming more fundamentalist in an effort to purge themselves of the corruption that allowed this to happen."

 dg_sunni.003.d:1 "$COUNTRY_RELIGION$ Mullahs are beginning to question why the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has never gone on the Hajj. It is, after all, a duty of all adult Muslims to make a pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina once in their lifetime if they are able - and surely a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] such as [Root.Monarch.GetName] is able? The Ulema have been known to make exceptions for rulers who were fighting Jihad, but [Root.Country.GetName] is at peace. Perhaps it is an auspicious year to go?\n\nIt was not unknown for a Muslim ruler to travel along with a full retinue to faraway Mecca for the Hajj. Doing so was costly and dangerous, since [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was often gone for months or years, but it was an act of great piety that could gain [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] the support of the Ulema."

Unhappily, this even includes pilgrims journeying to Mecca for the Hajj! Nomadic raiders have been particularly fierce this year, robbing and even slaying hundreds of pilgrims. The Sharif of Mecca demands that we do something to stop these attacks from happening, arguing that Mecca deserves special protection from a Muslim [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Usually these floods are localized, but occasionally they lead to death and destruction. Now it has left the Kaaba - the black stone shrine towards which all Muslims pray - dangerously damaged.\n\nThis is an ill omen, but not unprecedented. After all, the Hadith tell how Muhammad (peace be upon him) solved a dispute and laid the cornerstone in the Kaaba after it was damaged by flooding in 600 CE. This terrible accident now gives the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the chance to follow in his footsteps."

Four rival schools of thought, or 'Madh'hab', emerged in Sunni Islam to provide answers to these questions. Trained in one of the four schools, religious scholars known as Ulema acted as judges, mediators and advisors, in sharp contrast to the emotional and personal spiritualism of the Sufis.\n\nBecause of the decentralised nature of Islam, rulers had some authority over the Ulema, able to favour one school over others - but the Ulema had the authority to decide if the ruler's actions were just, so a wise ruler treated them with respect. The §GHanafi§! school is the oldest, teaching a liberal approach to law that emphasises human reason, dominating Central Asia and Anatolia. The §GHanbali§! school takes a more conservative view, preferring to avoid setting precedents, instead relying on scripture as much as possible. It dominates in the Arabian peninsula, especially among more traditional Muslims. The §GMaliki§! school is unique in that it regards the people of Medina as 'living sunnah' whose opinions and approval decide law for Muslims, and is popular among African Muslims.

This meant that their lives, property and very souls were forfeit - at least in theory.\n\nSunni Islam was so widespread in part because it tolerated a wide diversity of opinion and beliefs. There were limits to this, though: when a belief was too radical - such as Shi'a Islam or the Druze - it could be considered Mulhid (deviant). Even then it might be tolerated as long as it did not engage in seditious activities. Due to the decentralised nature of Sunni Islam, it was always possible to find Ulema who would argue that they were sinners rather than apostates.

The two concepts were not mutually exclusive, and there was some room to decide to place outsiders in one or the other category depending on their reaction to Ibadism. For this reason, the doctrine of 'al Wuquf' dominated: the reservation of attitude until an Ibadi was sure of the outsider's reactions.

'Dita', or Defence, was the rule that in times when the Ibadi community came under a military threat, they should elect an Imam to lead the war against the invader.

One form of rebellion against foreign rule was to look for a legitimate form of Islam that rejected the central authority of the Caliph. Ibadism fit that description. A Muslim sect that split off from mainstream Islam shortly after the death of the prophet, Ibadis rejected the idea that Imams had to be Quraish or even Arabic and demanded the election of Imams rather than making it a hereditary office. At the same time, they were fundamentalists who demanded scriptural support for everything, making them hard to criticise on religious grounds. In this manner, Ibadi heresies appeared and rebelled against the rule of the Caliphs in Yemen, Iraq, and North Africa, and now this heresy has found new life among the $PROVINCECULTURE$ of $PROVINCENAME$."

 dg_ibadi.005.d:1 "Islam began as an Arab movement. Unified, Arab raiders were able to expand far beyond their homeland, bringing great wealth and status. However, with their own success came the seeds of their downfall: as the religion spread to the corners of the world, Arabs played an increasingly smaller role. With the fall of the Caliphate and the rise of independent Sultanates, many Arabs returned to their original status - poor and unimportant. This bred resentment among the Bedouins of Arabia, and a desire to return to the fundamentalist roots of their religion. This found voice in the Ibadi heresy, although in Arabia it was closer to the earlier Kharjites, who applied fundamentalist rules to their faith but emphasised Arab predominance at the same time."

The Caliph was always chosen from the descendants of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and acted as a supreme religious authority among Muslims who recognised his authority. Originally it was a powerful office, but after the tenth century it became little more than a hollow title as sultans and emirs established their independence from the Caliphate and the Ulema reasserted their authority over scripture. By the fall of Baghdad in 1258 the authority of the Caliphs had become a polite fiction outside the country that he ruled...but the title could still inspire dreams of unifying Islam and establishing a great Islamic empire."

During the middle ages this feat was beyond the ability of most people, but for princes and sultans anything was possible. It was not unknown for a Muslim ruler to travel along with a full retinue to faraway Mecca for the Hajj. Doing so was costly and dangerous, since he was often gone for months or years, but it was an act of great piety that could gain him the support of the Ulema."

Heathens such as Zoroastrians or Hindus could pay a heavy tax in order to continue practising their religion without interference from the government.

 millet_system_title:1 "§G†§! Introduce the Millet system"
 millet_system_desc:1 "In Islam, non-Muslims whose faiths predated Islam and were based in scripture - Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians - were considered Children of the Book. These '§BDhimmi§W' heathens were guaranteed certain rights in a Muslim state. In the $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ tradition, these rights were enforced by dividing $COUNTRY$ not by region but by confession, creating separate §BMillets§W ('nations') for each religion in the empire. Each millet had almost total legal authority over subjects of that faith and could pass laws and collect taxes as long as it remained loyal to the $MONARCHTITLE$. In effect, this made the Christian patriarch responsible for the good behaviour of his followers and ensured that the Christian church would be complicit in supporting the state and preventing rebellion and even nationalism among the heathens of the empire. On the other hand, the system also grouped together all Muslims as one Millet, which caused some problems with the different sects."

Originally he ruled over all Muslims in fact as well as in name, but over time provincial governors took on increasing independence. Eventually the Caliph became little more than a puppet of the Sultans who supposedly served him, occasionally brought out into public to provide legitimacy to them. However, the title still commanded respect from the faithful and occasionally an ambitious Caliph attempted to restore the honour of the position."
