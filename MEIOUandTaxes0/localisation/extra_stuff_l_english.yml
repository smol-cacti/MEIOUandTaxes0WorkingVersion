From the sixteenth century onwards, groups of European investors formed companies to underwrite and profit from the exploration of Africa, India, Asia, the Caribbean and North America, usually under the patronage of one state, which issued the company's charter. But chartered companies go back into the medieval period. Authorizations of charters enabled even small states to greatly augment their influence by indirect rule, steering private resources into national pursuits of exploration and trade. As they grew wealthier, some companies developed extensive administrations for their ventures, and frequently conducted local affairs with little homeland oversight."

In their stead we have developed a lighter, faster and more manoeuvrable adaptation of the basic design, with a similar, but shallower and flatter hull, and fewer oars. This design proved so effective that it dominated warfare in the Isles well into the sixteenth century. It also provided great utility as a civilian ship, finding common use in daily life, primarily for fishing, this being the source of much of the isles' food supply."

Both of these cultures have given us great traditions of martial bravery and personal ferocity, as they demand that our soldiers not think twice before plunging headlong into battle, and conduct themselves with dauntless fury. As a result of this, our warriors, while often ill-disciplined, are a fearsome foe and the match of any more standardised army."

The Lordship is subject to a different form of vassalage, treated with respect and dignity from the Scottish kings to the East, and the English kings in the South. It is almost as though our lords are recognised as kings, welcome and sought after by every British court."

In the style of Somerled, our vast fleet shall be our bridge from island to island, from peace to war, and from submission to glory. But this fleet will see the death of foreign kings, not our own."
