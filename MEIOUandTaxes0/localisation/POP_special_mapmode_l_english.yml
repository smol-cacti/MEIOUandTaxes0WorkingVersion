 POP_special_MAPMODE.110.d: "This mapmode allows the player to see provincial farming efficiency. Farming Efficiency determines how much extra food each rural population is making.

Good weather generates better crop yields and thus better nutrition, which improves population growth and reduces the risk of famine.

These menu options allow the player to show how much of the region's excess food has already been consumed, and how much remains unconsumed.

Highly urbanised regions tend to be highly affluent, but also highly vulnerable to disruption. Usually, high urbanisation is either supported by robust farming efficiency in a region or via food imports, though it is usually the former."

When there is a large urban population relative to a small urban gravity value, fewer people move to the city. Conversely, when there is a small urban population relative to a large gravity, more people move to the city. Another way to look at it is that Urban Saturation represents the amount of opportunity that exists in a city. If a plague or an enemy army comes and kills a significant amount of population in a city, the Urban Saturation becomes significantly lower, since there are now many jobs vacated by the people that were there before."

There are three tiers of urban goods, and the higher your city's skill, the more access that city has to those superior tiers of goods. 25 skill is needed to make a Tier 2 good, and 75 skill is needed to make a Tier 3 good. Centres of production generate skill over time, and without a centre of production, a city's skill will diminish down to 25. Centres of production distribute their skill to other provinces in the subcontinent, and once a city has 150 skill, that rate of transmission doubles."

While you can take many, many measures to increase population and 'modify' Innate Fertility throughout the game to increase a province's population capacity, Innate Fertility is the ultimate anchor. If a province's population is artificially below its Innate Fertility, rural population growth rate will be driven up faster.

 POP_special_MAPMODE.600.d: "From here you can show Settlement Gravity and Tribal Population from the trade mapmode. Tribes settle over time based on many factors, including terrain, the influence of nearby settled populations, trade, local urban population, the presence of legalistic structures and pressure from centralised states. The Settlement Gravity of a province represents these factors, and their exponential pull on the tribal population. Negative gravity will lead to a larger tribal population, while positive gravity will encourage tribes to settle down and integrate. The more settled a tribal province is, the more it invests in its agricultural economy at the expense of its tribal host."

The largest fraction of one religion in a province will be the province's main religion, while the other parts are represented as minority modifiers. Minorities can be accepted, tolerated, persecuted or oppressed based on your tolerance of the true faith, heretics and heathens, and will give different bonuses and random events based on this."
