 jurchen_ascendancy.1.t:1 "National script for [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 jurchen_ascendancy.1.d:1 "During the centuries since the fall of Great Jin dynasty our people were either illiterate or using Mongol script to write. Only exceptions were embassies to China when we were forced to use unwieldy Jurchen script of our ancestors, which only but handful still remember how to write. This sad state of affairs has to end right now.\n Should we create a new script, based on simpler Mongol? Or should we continue to honour the memory of our ancestors and restore the writing system to its former glory?"

However under the rulership of a new great Khan, we could once again restore our mighty empire.\n Shall we destroy previous tribal relationships and create a banner system, uniting or emancipating all our people? Or maybe we should look up to our ancestors for inspiration and rebuild our strength based on clans?"
