 byz_recover_greece_title:1 "Recover Greece"
 byz_recover_greece_desc:1 "The Roman Empire has been in decline for centuries. Now even the core of the Empire, Asia Minor and Greece have been lost to invaders.\nMost of Makedonia, held by the Serbian 'Empire'.\nThe Duchy of Athens, lost after the Sack of Constantinople, in Personal Union with the Crown of Aragon.\nThe Principality of Achaia, likewise lost after the Sack of Constantinople.\nThe Despotate of Morea, technically Roman, but held by the disloyal Kantakouzenos.\nVenetian holdings in Morea and Thessalia, gained after their godless 'Crusaders' sacked The City.\n\nWe must recover the core of our empire in the west and drive out the Latins and the Slavs, for Rhomania!"
 byz_recover_albania_title:1 "Annex Albania"
 byz_recover_albania_desc:1 "The tribes of Albania have held their independence since the devastation of the Fourth Crusade, standing in open defiance of Rhomania. The time has come to remind them of the totality of our rule."
 byz_recover_serbia_title:1 "Suppress Serbia"
 byz_recover_serbia_desc:1 "The lands beyond Greece had once been unified under the Serbs, yet now the polity falls to ruin. The deterioration and decentralisation of the Serbs provides us with a newfound opportunity, to restore Serbia to Roman rule once more."
 byz_recover_illyria_title:1 "Regain Illyría"
 byz_recover_illyria_desc:1 "The Adriatic was once the dividing line of the Empire, yet it was lost to Schismatics in the twelfth century. Regaining it would extend Roman power into the heart of Europe and bring Italy back into our sphere of influence."
 byz_destroy_venice_title:1 "Destroy Venice"
 byz_destroy_venice_desc:1 "The Fourth Crusade was the darkest hour of our Empire, subjecting the Roman people to milenia of foreign domination. Under the direction of the Venetian devils, our Empire suffered a humiliating defeat. No longer will we bear this shame. It is time for Venice to pay for its treachery, and face the wrath of Rome. All will remember the day that Rome came to Venice."
 byz_recover_sicily_title:1 "Subjugate Sicily"
 byz_recover_sicily_desc:1 "Lost to an Arab invasion in the tenth century, Sicily has long remained the gateway to further invasions of Africa and beyond. Reclaiming the island would provide us both an incredible staging point, and a long-time breadbasket."
 byz_recover_tunis_title:1 "Reconquer Africa"
 byz_recover_tunis_desc:1 "Centred on Carthage, the Exarchate of Africa resisted the Arab invasion for two generations before it too was lost to Rome. Its passing was a sad fate for the city that once rivalled the empire itself. Let us restore this province to Roman rule."
 byz_recover_mauretania_title:1 "Acquire Mauretania"
 byz_recover_mauretania_desc:1 "The raids of the Barbary Corsairs have long originated from their safe ports along the coast of Mauretania. Reconquering the province would remove one of the last obstacles to domination of the Mediterranean."
 
 byz_restore_konstantinoupolis_title:1 "Restore The City"
 byz_restore_konstantinoupolis_desc:1 "Once the Queen of Cities, Constantinople no longer commands the world's attention. Years of mismanagement and financial hardship have left the city in poor shape. For Rome to truly rise once more, the heart of the Empire must be restored to glory."
 byz_recover_bulgaria_title:1 "Crush Bulgaria"
 byz_recover_bulgaria_desc:1 "When the Bulgars revolted in 1186, they seized land tantalizingly close to Constantinople itself. Without that buffer in the north, the Emperor was constantly distracted by northern barbarians at times when he was most needed elsewhere. Let our ruler claim once again the title of Bulgar-Slayer."
 byz_foothold_in_italy_title:1 "Italian Foothold"
 byz_foothold_in_italy_desc:1 "The eastern islands of the Adriatic were lost in the thirteenth century. Recovering those islands would not only protect the capital, it would also open the door to the recovery of Italy and the Western Empire."
 byz_recover_naples_title:1 "Smash Naples"
 byz_recover_naples_desc:1 "The boot of Italy remained Roman long after the fall of Rome. Lost to the Normans in the eleventh century, Bari was a bastion of the Orthodox faith and Greek culture in Western Europe. It is time for Naples to remember this."

 byz_recover_west_islands_title:1 "Western Islands"
 byz_recover_west_islands_desc:1 "The islands of the West were key to controlling the Mediterranean trade, yet they were lost to the Arabs one by one until the last fort in Syracuse fell in the tenth century.

 byz_recover_south_spain_title:1 "Iberian Foothold"

 byz_recover_britannia_title:1 "Obliterate Britannia"
 byz_recover_britannia_desc:1 "The rebel province of Britannia lies beyond the so called 'English Channel'. It is time to restore these distant isles to the fold. Let us mobilise the grand fleet of Rome, and crush these rebels once and for all."
 
 byz_recover_the_coast_of_asia_minor_title:1 "Anatolian Coast"
 byz_recover_the_coast_of_asia_minor_desc:1 "Constantinople is in a unique position to dominate both Europe and Asia Minor. The Romans held on to remnants of Western Anatolia against the Turks until the fourteenth century. The Greeks remaining in the Thracian Theme of yesteryear still hunger for our rule to return."
 byz_recover_east_islands_title:1 "Recover the Aegean"
 byz_recover_east_islands_desc:1 "The Greek islands of the Mediterranean were wrested from our hands by the thirteenth century, and even now suffer under the yoke of heretics and heathens. Regain them, and we have the footing we need to take back the Levant and Egypt."

 byz_recover_antioch_title:1 "Recover Antioch"
 byz_recover_antioch_desc:1 "The seat of a Patriarch, Antioch remained in Roman hands until the eleventh century. Constantinople's influence remained long after its soldiers were forced out. Bringing back the city to the empire would make us once again the Defender of the Faith!"
 byz_recover_jerusalem_title:1 "Reconquer the Holy City"
 byz_recover_jerusalem_desc:1 "Jerusalem is the holiest site in all Christendom - and we lost it in the seventh century. We can only expunge this shame by recovering it for the empire, restoring the Patriarch to this throne and rededicating its churches to the one true God!"
 byz_recover_egypt_title:1 "Reconquer Egypt"
 byz_recover_egypt_desc:1 "Once the breadbasket of the empire, Egypt's loss was a shock to the empire that it never recovered from. Despite many attempts, it was never regained for Constantinople...until now."
 byz_recover_central_italy_title:1 "Control Central Italy"
 byz_recover_central_italy_desc:1 "Made the capital of the Empire for its forbidding location, Ravenna held out against the Lombards until the eigth century. With the lands of centre of Italy in Roman hands, Rome's safely can be assured once more."
 byz_recover_north_italy_title:1 "Conquer Lombardia"
 byz_recover_north_italy_desc:1 "Not since the days of the united Empire has Rome held the Po Valley in its grasp. It is time to conquer the last region of Italy that stands in defiance of Rome, and the realisation of our destiny."

 byz_to_the_rhine_and_danube_desc:1 "The German invaders have long held the lands along the great rivers of the Rhine, and the Danube.

 byz_stabilize_the_empire_title:1 "Stabilise the Empire"
 byz_stabilize_the_empire_desc:1 "The dream of Imperial Reconquest lies at the very heart of the Roman people. To achieve such an ambitious goal, we must rise above the instability and chaos of recent times. Rome must rise once more, stronger, united and absolute in its will to reclaim what is rightfully ours."
 byz_recover_west_anatolia_title:1 "Seize West Anatolia"
 byz_recover_west_anatolia_desc:1 "The loss of Western Anatolia in the eleventh century was the catalyst for the First Crusade and helped the empire regain its lost territory - for a time. With the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, Western Anatolia was lost to the empire...until now. Let us regain the Carabisian Theme for Rome!"
 byz_recover_central_anatolia_title:1 "Central Anatolia"
 byz_recover_central_anatolia_desc:1 "The Anatolian interior was conquered by the Turks at the end of the twelfth century, ripping out the heart of Asia Minor and forcing the Romans to maintain a longer border with fewer troops. Recovering it is the most important step to regaining our lost empire, and recovering the old Opsician Theme is the obvious first step."
 byz_armenian_highlands_title:1 "The Armenian Highlands"
 byz_armenian_highlands_desc:1 "In a single day at Manzikert half of Asia Minor fell to the Turks. What was once a loyal Theme of the empire became little more than a nightmare. It is time for its residents to wake up to a new day of Roman rule."
 byz_recover_trebizond_title:1 "Subdue Trebizond"
 byz_recover_trebizond_desc:1 "The Fourth Crusade was devastating for the fragile Empire. Although parts of the Empire remained in Greek hands, the Pontic coast was never regained for Constantinople. It is time to crush the false pretender, and restore the coast to Roman rule."
 byz_recover_crimea_title:1 "Bosporan Kingdom"
 byz_recover_crimea_desc:1 "Constantinople should rightfully command all the trade from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, but Italian interests and rebels forced her to destitution. Bringing our soldiers to the shores of the Crimea will once more reaffirm our status as a trading power."
 byz_the_pentarchy_title:1 "The Pentarchy"
 byz_the_pentarchy_desc:1 "The Great Schism has long left Christianity divided, fuelled by the loss of the great seats of Antiquity. If we could restore Roman control over all five seats, perhaps we could end the Schism once and for all."
 byz_restore_rome_to_glory_title:1 "Restore Rome to Glory"
 byz_restore_rome_to_glory_desc:1 "The Rome of Antiquity was a glorious city, the envy of the world. All roads led to a city of over a million people, sustained through the secure grain trade of the Mediterranean. With Rome once more in Roman hands, we have an opportunity to rebuild the city with newfound glory for all to behold."
 byz_depose_false_emperor_title:1 "Depose the False Emperor"
 byz_depose_false_emperor_desc:1 "As the Reconquest continues, a pressing issue has arisen. While our triumphs are many, the continued existence of the False Emperor leaves a potential challenger to the absolution of Roman rule. We must bear this insult no longer."
