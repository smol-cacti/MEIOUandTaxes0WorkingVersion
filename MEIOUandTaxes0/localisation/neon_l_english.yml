 neon.EVTDESC3:1 "The FERT motto was adopted by Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia-Piedmont. Scholars differ in their interpretation of the acronym. Some say it means 'We are bound by treaty and by religion', others 'His strength conquered Rhodes', yet others 'Faith is the protector of our Kingdom'."

 flavor_mar.EVTNAME4:1 "Tiger Claws"
 flavor_mar.EVTDESC4:1 "Recent developments in Maratha warfare have led to the popularity of an unusual kind of weapon - the banh naka, or tiger claw. It's designed to fit over the knuckles or be concealed under and against the palm.

 flavor_mar.EVTNAME2:1 "The Peshwa Period"
 flavor_mar.EVTDESC2:1 "After Balaji Vishwanath's death in April 1720, his son, Baji Rao I was appointed as Peshwa by Chattrapati Shahu. Shahu possessed a strong capacity for recognising talent, and actually caused a social revolution by bringing capable people into power irrespective of their social status. This was an indication of a great social mobility within the Maratha Empire, enabling its rapid expansion. During this era, Peshwas belonging to the (Bhat) Deshmukh Marathi Brahmin family controlled the Maratha army and later became the hereditary rulers of the Maratha Empire from 1749 to 1818. During their reign, the Maratha empire reached its zenith ruling most of the Indian Subcontinent. Prior to 1700, one Peshwa received the status of imperial regent for eight or nine years. They oversaw the greatest expansion of the Maratha Empire around 1760 with the help of Sardars like Holkar, Scindia (Shinde), Bhosale, and Gaekwad (Dhane). Other Generals such as Pantpratinidhi, Panse, Vinchurkar, Pethe, Raste, Phadke, Patwardhan, Pawar, Pandit, Purandare and Mehendale also played an important part in the expansion."

 flavor_mar.EVTNAME3:1 "The Confederacy Period"
 flavor_mar.EVTDESC3:1 "During this period, various chiefs and statesman became de facto rulers. The Peshwa was relegated to secondary position. He also became ceremonial king especially after the death of Peshwa Madhavrao I. After 1761, young Madhavrao Peshwa tried his best to rebuild the empire in spite of his frail health and reinstated the Maratha authority over North India, 10 years after the battle of Panipat. In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, semi-autonomy was given to strongest of the knights. The result was an extremely decentralised nation in which the government had little to no ability to control the provinces or their rulers."
 flavor_mar.EVTOPTA3:1 "We have no choice but to grant this autonomy"
 flavor_mar.EVTOPTB3:1 "No, we should try to hold the realm together"
 maratha_confederacy:1 "Confederacy"

 java.EVTNAME1:1 "The Decline of Majapahit"

 java.EVTNAME4:1 "The Reforms of Iskandar Muda"
 java.EVTDESC4:1 "Iskandar Muda was the twelfth Sultan of Aceh, under whom the sultanate achieved its greatest territorial extent, and was the strongest power and wealthiest state in the western Indonesian archipelago and the Strait of Malacca. His conquests have been compared to those of Alexander the Great. One reason for Iskandar Muda's success, in contrast to the weaker sultans who preceded and succeeded him, was his ability to suppress the Acehnese elite. Through the royal monopoly on trade, he was able to keep them dependant on his favour. He sought to create a new nobility of 'war leaders' whom he gave districts in feudal tenure. He passed legal reforms which created a network of courts using Islamic jurisprudence. His system of law and administration became a model for other Islamic states in Indonesia. Iskandar Muda's reign was also marked by considerable brutality, directed at disobedient subjects. He also did not hesitate to execute wealthy subjects and confiscate their wealth."

 java.EVTNAME6:1 "Demak becomes a Centre of Trade"
 java.EVTDESC6:1 "After the fall of Majapahit, Demak became a major trading port. The port was an important node on the route that connected the Moluccas to Malacca and beyond. As such its hold on the trade of high-value spices such as cloves put it in a position of prominence in Java."

 indislam.EVTDESC7:1 "Around 1540, together with the Islamic advance, a Hindu reformation movement led by Dang Hyang Nirartha took place, leading to the introduction of the Padmasana shrine in honour of the 'Supreme God' Acintya. This reformation cemented the Hindu tradition of Bali, allowing it to resist the tide of Islamic missionary activity. Other nations could do the same."

 indislam.2b:1 "Lord Brahma reigns here, not Allah"
 borneo.t1:1 "Foundation of the Lanfang Republic"
 borneo.d1:1 "The sultans of Western Borneo imported Chinese labourers in the eighteenth century to work in gold or tin mines. The founding father of the Lanfang Republic was Luo Fangbo who hailed from Meizhou in Guangdong Province. Chinese settlers have long lived on Borneo island, with most engaging in trading and mining. They formed their own companies, among which was the Southern Company headed by Luo. As Dutch imperialism encroached upon modern-day Indonesia, Luo established the Lanfang Republic in 1777 (with its capital in East Wanjin) to protect the Chinese settlers and other indigenous peoples from Dutch oppression. The settlers subsequently elected Luo as their inaugural president. Luo implemented many democratic principles, including the idea that all matters of state must involve the consultation of the republic's citizenry. He also created a comprehensive set of executive, legislative, and judicial agencies. The Republic did not have a standing military, but had a defence ministry that administered a national militia based on conscription. During peacetime, the populace mostly engaged in farming, production, trading, and mining. Lanfang's administrative divisions included three tiers (province, prefecture, and county) with the people electing leaders for all levels. Although Luo discarded the ancient institutions of monarchism and dynastic succession, he continued to adhere to many Chinese traditions. For example, he established the founding year of the republic as the first year of the calendar. Moreover, he submitted a report to the Chinese emperor notifying him about the Republic's founding and paid tribute to the Chinese Qing Empire. Although the Republic had both ethnic Chinese citizens (numbering in the tens of thousands) and indigenous subjects (numbering in the hundreds of thousands), the ethnic Chinese were the only ones who voted in presidential elections. Thus, Luo would not dare call himself a king in front of the ethnic Chinese citizens, but was not afraid to do so in front of his indigenous subjects."
