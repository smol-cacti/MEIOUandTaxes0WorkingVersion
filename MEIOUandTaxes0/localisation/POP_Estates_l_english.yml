 POP_Estates_Interactions.001.t: "Visiting the Courts of the Greater Nobles"
 POP_Estates_Interactions.001.d: "The Greater Nobles Estate consists of nobles in your realm that exert significant rights and privileges relative to the crown, making them a force to be reckoned with. Because of these special rights, they are able to behave more autonomously and thereby seize a larger percentage of state income for themselves as opposed to the crown.\n\nA strong estate of Greater Nobles tends to behave as a unified block to expand their interests and can therefore be a powerful ally or fierce enemy. By actively siding against Greater Nobles and marginalizing their power, a prudent ruler will be able to demote Greater Nobles to Lesser Nobles, giving the crown more control. If you choose this path, however, be prepared for significant resistance.\n\nTreasury: [Root.estate_greater_nobles_treasury.GetValue]¤\nAnnual Income: [Root.estate_greater_nobles_treasury_annual.GetValue]¤\nArmy Maintenance Cost: [Root.estate_greater_nobles_army_maintenance.GetValue]¤\nPower in $COUNTRY$: [Root.estate_greater_nobles_power.GetValue]% among landed estates.\nPrivileges Granted: [Root.privilege_level.GetValue]\nRegiments in Reserve: [Root.estate_greater_nobles_infantry.GetValue]£infantry_icon_small£ [Root.estate_greater_nobles_cavalry.GetValue]£cavalry_icon_small£ [Root.estate_greater_nobles_artillery.GetValue]£artillery_icon_small£"

The Greater Nobles are capable of accumulating the most privileges of any estate, many of which have far-reaching consequences.\n\nAs with other estates, the Greater Nobles will tend to demand more privileges when they have few and demand fewer privileges the more they have. They will also demand privileges more often the larger your country's population is, as greater distances and a more complex state make it easier for them to leverage their power and influence to gain special advantages."

However, in granting these privileges, we give the Greater Nobles leverage against our government, and thus makes it easier to corrupt. Granting privileges should be done judiciously, especially during troubled times or when you need the support of the Greater Nobles for a compelling reason. Offering favours is not only a good way to gain loyalty with an estate, but also a way to gain stability.\n\nOnce you select a privilege to grant, it cannot be removed for at least 10 years, and you can only grant a new privilege after 3 years."

To reverse this trend and improve our education level, we must spend resources to generate growth in education.\n\nThere are two major components of education in our country which work in tandem: our education endowment and our university system. Upper class populations are the primary recipient of education, though church spending exists on your education exists to represent education due to scholasticism.\n\nAs your education level gets higher, it becomes costlier to improve further.

 POP_Estates_Interactions.3026.t: "The Education Endowment"
 POP_Estates_Interactions.3026.d: "The endowment is a large lump sum of money that finances education. Every year, 5% of the endowment is subtracted and then spent on improving our education level. The endowment is replenished by a number of different methods. The two major methods are state financing and money spent by the church.\n\nWith state financing, we can set a yearly budget on education or give lump sums. In the case of church financing, the church will spend between 0–2 ducats to educate each of your upper classes. The number of ducats depends on your country's church influence, with more church influence giving more ducats.\n\nMoney spent on education is divided by your upper classes, since this is the target demographic which is primarily benefiting from education. In this sense, a small but highly developed country can achieve a significantly more educated populace than a large but undeveloped country."
 POP_Estates_Interactions.3026.a: "Thank you for the briefing."
 
 POP_Estates_Interactions.3027.t: "Universities"
 POP_Estates_Interactions.3027.d: "Universities are critical to achieving a high education level. Each university has a number of 'pupil' slots capable of educating upper class pops. Each slot educates 1 upper class pop (pupils). The first, second, and third level of universities each educate 3, 6, and 9 pupils.\n\nThese slots are divided into domestic slots and prestige slots. Domestic slots are slots dedicated to educating students in nearby areas. These slots can be taken by foreign students on some occasions, but that is rare and hard to see. Prestige slots are different from domestic slots in a sense that they are given to students from high art power provinces, both domestic and foreign. These slots bring art power to a university and make it more prestigious. You can still compete for these slots by building up your own cities, but they will have to compete with students from more urbanised and developed areas.\n\nA university can educate any upper class citizen in your country, doubling the effect of your education endowment for that upper class pop. So for instance, if you have 9 upper class pops in your country and 3 small universities, every population has access to a university, thus the effect of your education endowment is doubled. If only half of your population has access to university slots, you only gain half the bonus.\n\nA university built in a province with upper classes will educate those upper classes first, giving them an additional 0.5x bonus. If you have extra pupil slots after all of your upper classes have university access, you have one of two choices when it comes to utilising the rest.\n\nThe first option is to open your universities to foreign students. Any foreign upper class pop who does not have access to a university can instead use your university for a fee, the only requirement is that the pupil must come from a province of the same religion and the same culture group as the province containing the university. The second option is to close your universities to outsiders, which allows your domestic pupils to 'double study' or 'triple study' in that slot. However, each additional slot a pupil takes up beyond the first will endow less and less of a bonus (2, 2.5, 2.75)."

One time lump sum endowments can also be added from state or non-state actors. The more we spend on education, the faster education increases, but there is more resistance to gains the higher and higher our education level gets.

It will also be 50% less likely for the plague to jump into our trade centres from abroad.\n\nIf we so choose, we can attempt to mitigate the anger caused to the Burghers, but the cost of doing so will be relative to the number of trade centres in our country."

 POP_Estates_Interactions.400.d: "As a tribal government, you have little direct or legal control over the various tribes of your society. Instead, a leader leverages his reputation and relationships with tribal members to exact tribute both financially and in manpower. The more tribute the tribes pay, the more money is taken from the tribal wealth pool. This weakens the tribes but empowers the horde. How much tribute you gain depends on your Tribal Unity. A horde with 100 Tribal Unity will gain 100% the eligible tribute, whereas a horde with 50% Tribal Unity will only gain 50% of the eligible tribute. The other 50% instead goes toward tribal wealth."

 POP_Census.700.t: "Jizya Taxes Due"
 POP_Census.700.d: "The Jizya taxes we have levied against the Dhimmi have come due, and funds flood into our coffers! The value of the tax depends on the total number of Dhimmi subjects in our country as well as the economic condition of the provinces where they reside.\n\nWhile these additional funds to our treasury are welcome, it is important to note that this tax is skimmed from the wealth of the provinces paying the Jizya. Thus, the more Dhimmi there are in a province subject to the tax, the more inhibited economic growth is in that province. However, provinces with high Dhimmi populations will have a slight boost to population growth, due to the fact that they no longer need to serve in the military."
