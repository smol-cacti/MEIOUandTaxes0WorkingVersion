 japan.3.da:1 "Today the last Emperor of the Southern Court has surrendered his capital. Our victorious retainers have either killed in combat or captured the leaders of the rebellion.

 japan.3.db:1 "Today the last Emperor of the Southern Court has surrendered his capital seeing the futility of further warfare. Our victorious retainers have either killed in combat or captured the leaders of the rebellion. Per the conducted treaty, the Imperial Regalia will return to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and the future successions will be alternating between two lines of the dynasty.\n\nHopefully, the military administration can bring the Land of the Rising Sun the peace and prosperity it deserves."

 japan.5.t:1 "[Root.Tag.GetName] Shogunate"
 japan.5.d:1 "The year [GetYear] marks the beginning of a new era, an era of the hegemony of [Root.Tag.GetName] over all of Japan. The Emperor in his decree proclaimed [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] his newest representative, the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Even though right now there might be retainers holding traitorous thoughts, soon all of Japan will be united under the banner of [Root.Tag.GetName]!"
 japan.5a:1 "Tenka Tôitsu!"
 japan.6.t:1 "[From.Tag.GetName] Shogunate"
 japan.6.d:1 "News reached us from [From.Capital.GetName] that a new regime was proclaimed and legitimised by the Emperor. [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName] was proclaimed [From.Monarch.GetTitle] and he now sets out to rule over us. \n\nShall we join his grand enterprise and become loyal vassals? Or is it more prudent to strike now, when the regime is still young and unsteady?"
 japan.6a:1 "We bow before the new Shôgun."
 japan.6b:1 "This regime will be a short one."

 japan.7.d:1 "The head of the clan, [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName], has arrived at the [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to swear fealty to the new regime.

We shall confer a new title on him and make his domain a part of our administration."
 japan.7a:1 "A good choice"
 japan.8.t:1 "Defiance of [From.Tag.GetName]"
 japan.8.d:1 "This fool, [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName], dares to oppose the Emperor's decree and refuses to submit to us!

 japan.9.d:1 "Just now reached us news that [Root.Overlord.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName] adopted the Emperor as his son and will be now known as Daijô Tennô! This is a situation without a precedent, where a noble becomes a father of a god. How should we react to such event?"
 japan.9a:1 "This tantamounts to a blasphemy!"
 japan.9b:1 "Maybe this is the will of gods?"
 japan.10.t:1 "The Ceremony of Appointment"
 japan.10.d:1 "With this ceremony [Root.Tag.GetName] will no longer only represent of the Emperor, no longer his in-laws, but also a part of the Imperial line. No similar situation ever occurred before, never was the dynasty on such shaky ground. The lines between sacral duties of Emperors and secular rule of Shôguns did mingle with each other, but they never became one. At least, not until now.\n\nHowever, this situation, while perilous for the Emperor, poses also a danger to the Shogunate. The legitimacy of our regime stems from the Emperor's decree. What will our subjects do if we decide to topple the very power granting us the mandate?"
 japan.10a:1 "This is too risky"
 japan.10b:1 "There will be no questioning of our rule"

 japan.12.d:1 "Not minding the opposition [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName] become the father of the Emperor! This is unforgivable and we won't stand by when the Empire is nearing collapse!"
 japan.12a:1 "To arms!"
 japan.13.t:1 "A New Dynasty"
 japan.13.d:1 "With the passing of the great Daijô Tennô, his true son claimed the right to the throne and deposed the puppet confined to the Palace. The ancient regime has fallen, weak and ineffective, remaining for centuries a puppet in the hands of warlords. They are no more. Now, [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] will take over their Mandate and lead the Land of the Rising Sun towards a new era."

 japan.16.d:1 "The new Shôgun, [From.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Heir.Dynasty.GetName], has been elevated to the throne according to wishes of his predecessor. However, he is young, inexperienced, and unwilling to compromise. Should we depose him in favour of a more suitable candidate?"
 japan.16a:1 "We shouldn't create a precedent, it might trigger a war with those who could oppose the decision."
 japan.16b:1 "Control over Shogunate will bring glory to [Root.GetName]."
 japan.17.t:1 "Kanrei deposes Shôgun!"
 japan.17.d:1 "[From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName] used his influence at the government and deposed the young Shôgun. The new ruler is but a puppet in the hands of [From.GetName] and they have full control over Japan.\n\nWhat should be done?"

 japan.19a:1 "It is a great day for [Root.GetName]"
 japan.20.t:1 "A New Imperial Capital"
 japan.20.d:1 "Ravaged by war the old capital is now a shadow of its former past. On the other hand our capital, [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], saw prosperity and growth which made it a metropoly rivalling those of the Central Plain. Instead of having to sell his calligraphy to keep his court from starvation, the Emperor should travel to our region, to a place where he can recover his honour."
 japan.20a:1 "The envoys will soon return with an answer"
 japan.21.t:1 "Emperor's Response"
 japan.21.da:1 "This is a glorious day as our envoys returned with a message, that Tennô is at this very moment gathering his court to prepare for the journey to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]! No longer will the centre of Japan be in Kyauto. From now on Saikyau will be the new capital!"

 japan.21.de:1 "Unfortunately, our envoys returned without satisfactory news. Tennô has refused our offer being afraid to leave battered, but safe walls of his current palace. Maybe our capital is still lacking in splendour?"
 
 japan.24.t:1 "Adopting Local Name"
 japan.24.d:1 "The last scion of the [Root.tag.GetName] passed away. However, the people of [Root.capital.GetName] cannot be left lordless.

 japan.24a:1 "[Root.Tag.GetName] is reborn."
 japan.25.t:1 "The Position of Kanrei"
 japan.25.d:1 "Our lord died and with this the position of Kanrei will now be granted to another Daimyô. On his death there will be a possibility that the title will return to our hands. That is, unless we decide to contest the new Kanrei with our military..."
 japan.25a:1 "We shall see how the situation develops"
 japan.26.t:1 "Kyôto Kanrei"
 japan.26.d:1 "With the passing of the previous title owner the position has passed from [From.tag.GetName] to [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. This is a great day, but our enemies might try to contest our influence..."

 japan.29.t:1 "Kanrei War Over"
 japan.29.da:1 "[From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName] has successfully warred over the position of Kyôto Kanrei. This sad day only showcased our inability to stop warfare between our subjects and is bound to create discontent throughout the nation."
 japan.29.db:1 "[From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName] defeated the forced of Kyôto Kanrei and took over the position. Shôgun [Root.Overlord.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Overlord.Monarch.GetName] failed to intervene in this matter and allowed for might to dictate rules. Do we need such inefficient and corrupt administration?"
 japan.29a:1 "A sad day..."
 japan.30.t:1 "Reforms of Administration"
 japan.30.d:1 "Imperial officials came with a new decree, all lands are to be nationalised and all private armies to be disbanded.

 japan.32.d:1 "This fossil from the previous era, [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName], refuses to accept the reforms which will strengthen the central government, but deprive him of power.

Previously the primary control over a province lied in the hands of Kuni no Tsukasa, Province Governor, but over time his power became shared with local Jitô, manor supervisor, and Shugo, constable, which slowly rendered the title honorary.\n\nThe Emperor now decreed that strong central administration demands restoration of local power of Kuni no Tsukasa at the expense of Shugo."
