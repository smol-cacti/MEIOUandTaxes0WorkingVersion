 dg_confucian.001.t:1 "The $MONARCHTITLE$'s Favour"
 dg_confucian.001.d:1 "Several competing schools of thought ran through $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ society. Confucian scholars taught a set of rules that promoted order, propriety and respect for one's elders, while Buddhist priests preached about giving up attachments in order to achieve enlightenment. Legalist judges wanted to apply the law blindly and strictly, while Taoist philosophers wanted everything in moderation. Having the $MONARCHTITLE$ show favour to one school could have lasting repercussions in $COUNTRY$."

 dg_confucian.003.d:1 "Taoists believed that by understanding the universe, one could understand oneself. Taoist alchemists were scientists interested in all things who experimented with herbs and minerals, trying to find an elixir that could impart eternal life to its drinker. The idea of living forever was a heady one, and $MONARCHTITLE$s sometimes patronised alchemists in hopes of attaining immortality."

 dg_confucian.004.d:1 "In a quest for immortality, $MONARCH$ imbibed any number of elixirs and concoctions designed to prolong life and improve health and fertility.

One notable group was the Jesuits, who focused on converting $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ aristocrats to Catholicism. To help persuade them, the Jesuits allowed converts to continue to venerate their ancestors. This practise caused conflict with other missionaries, who believed that the Jesuits were permitting heresy in their drive to gain influence at court, and the issue wound its way to the head of the Catholic Church: the pope.\n\nIn $YEAR$, the pope wrote a Papal Bull in which he commanded Catholic converts to give up ancestor worship. Faced with this decree, Chinese Catholics had to choose between fitting in to court or being excommunicated. This interference with his court infuriated the $MONARCHTITLE$, who was not accustomed to taking orders from foreigners. Foreign religions had often been tolerated by $COUNTRY$, but the toleration came with the understanding that the religion could coexist with Confucian ideals. Clearly, a message needed to be sent."

 introduce_imperial_examinations_desc:1 "According to Confucius, the ideal state is one ruled benevolently by a wise scholar. China introduced a Confucian examination system in the Han dynasty. Since then, subjects who wanted to become officials studied the Confucian classics in order to pass state examinations. The system not only produced a steady supply of literate officials for the state, it also tied their loyalty to the emperor in a way that a landed aristocracy did not. Since that time, every Chinese dynasty and many countries beyond have introduced a similar system."

 irregular_imperial_examinations_title:1 "§G†§! Declare an irregular examination"
 irregular_imperial_examinations_desc:1 "Imperial examinations were normally held biannually or every three years, depending on the country. From time to time a ruler could declare a special \"Irregular\" exam - an examination held on the spot in order to fill vacancies that had arisen in the state bureaucracy. In some dynasties, the number of irregular examinations actually outnumbered the number of regular ones."
 dg_confucian.081.t:1 "The Imperial Examination System"
 dg_confucian.081.d:1 "The Confucian Examination system served the needs of China and other East Asian countries well for many centuries. Scholars spent many years studying classic texts with private tutors or at state-run institutions. Once they felt ready, they attended an examination held every three years, where they were tested on their understanding and memory of the books. Those few who passed were granted titles and eligible for positions within the state bureaucracy, while those who failed could try again in the next round. In so doing, the system ensured a constant supply of literate officials who shared the same background.\n\nHowever, not every state approached the system in the same way. For some, such as the Tang dynasty of China, the purpose of the examinations was to produce highly skilled bureaucrats. These exams demanded that candidates read about the \"Five Studies\": military strategy, civil law, taxation, agriculture and geography, in addition to Confucian philosophy.\n\nAlthough this system produced literate officials, they were not always effective ones in practise. Some dynasties preferred to focus instead on how the examinations brought together people from across the empire and from many backgrounds and gave them a common ideology that made them \"[Root.GetAdjective]\". Under this kind of system, candidates focused entirely on an intense knowledge of the Four Books of Confucianism and applied its philosophy to contemporary political problems in essays."
 dg_confucian.081.d_outsider:1 "\nStill a third system was introduced by foreign dynasties or those that ruled over a multi-ethnic empire. Realising the effectiveness of the examination system but also that their own people were at a disadvantage, they introduced racial quotas - not by population, but by a set number of officials from each race. In this way, they could keep any one culture from dominating the administration and ensure government positions for their followers without seeming oppressive."

Throughout this lengthy process, there were questions of subjectivity as well, since it was difficult to objectively mark essays that had different styles.\n\nOne solution to this problem arose in the private academies that taught candidates. A standardised essay format called the \"Eight-Legged Essay\" was introduced which prescribed essay formats: exactly 700 characters long and divided into exactly eight sections. Due to the limited length of the essay, there was an emphasis on rote learning of Confucian idioms, which meant the tests measured memorization of the classics rather than actual understanding. However, it was quick and objective to score, which reduced the costs and complaints of the entire system."

This proved to be an obstacle for those who did not speak Chinese as fluently, and candidates were known to request translations of the passages into their native tongues - something that went against the rules of the examination, but which seemed reasonable. The exams were not about forcing people to speak Chinese...or were they? It was tempting to allow ethnicities to write the examinations entirely in their own language."

 dg_confucian.085.d:1 "The needs of the state were not only found in helping farmers overcome famines or determining how high to raise taxes. There would always be war and rebellion, and since the bureaucracy was in charge of the army, it behoved officials to learn more about it. This was the philosophy of the Tang dynasty of China, who introduced new sections to the imperial examinations: tests of archery and horseback riding! In their era, parts of the city walls were turned into archery targets for scholars to practise on, and the examinations became far more interesting to watch for the public."

 dg_confucian.087.d:1 "[Root.GetAdjective] poetry and literature are flourishing, in part due to a common theme: failing the imperial examinations.\n\nThe imperial examinations were famously difficult. A common saying was \"One only passes the exams in his fifties, though he knew the books well in his thirties.\" The reward for passing the examinations was great, but the costs could be even greater. It took years of study to even attempt the exams, and pass rates could be as low as one in a hundred candidates. Even then, reaching any position of importance required first passing a local examination, then moving on to a more competitive provincial exam, then a district exam, and only finally the national examinations that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would oversee. The saving grace for many candidates was that they could always try again three years later. Some continued to take the test into their old age!\n\nAll this created a large literate class who needed employment. Many became teachers to others who sought to pass the examinations while others became poets, authors and artists. The result was not only that art and literature flourished, but that many writers focused on their personal tragedy: failing the exams."

Likewise, if the descendants of a bureaucrat failed to pass the exam, they could eventually lose their status. This, combined with the low chances of passing, meant that candidates had every reason to cheat. To keep the exams fair, officials introduced increasingly strict rules: candidates were isolated in cells, could not write their names on exams, and even had their essays copied before marking to avoid recognising candidates by their handwriting. In response, an entire industry emerged: candidates bought miniature books they could conceal in their hands, sewed passages from texts into their clothes, wrote notes on their fans and hired scholars to take the exams for them in their place.

They believe that the examination system is designed to prevent the poor from rising above their station. After all, they argue, it requires a decade or more of study from private schools and tutors, something that is beyond the ability of all but the aristocracy to afford. While some peasants do rise into the gentry through the examinations, they never made up more than half of all candidates, despite making up more than nine-tenths of the population."
 dg_confucian.092.d_2:1 "\nA notable poet has authored a book which satirizes the system.

This problem was exacerbated by having quotas in place for each ethnicity. Since the quotas were not based on population, there were just as many [Root.Culture.GetName] graduates as any other group - even if one group outnumbered the other five to one! However, this also meant fewer applicants - and at times, the number of applicants from one ethnicity was so small that there simply weren't enough passing candidates to fill their spots. Meanwhile, competition became increasingly fierce among members of populous ethnicities, who needed to perform far better to gain one of their few spots each examination.\n\nOne solution to this was to gradually relax the quotas, shrinking the number of graduates from smaller groups while enlarging the number from more populous ones - tacitly admitting the failure of the policy. More palatable was to lower the standards for smaller groups so that even when few candidates applied, enough graduates were found to meet quotas. A third option was to simply ignore the problem and force the bureaucracy to do without replacements."

All this helped to keep $PROVINCENAME$ safe, but also showed clearly how the $MONARCHTITLE$ was losing $RULER_ADJ$ grasp on the country."
 dg_mahayana.048.t:1 "Ikki Begins Feud"
 dg_mahayana.048.d:1 "Ikki leagues did help protect the countryside from bandits, but they had limited success in keeping it safe from feuding monks. Because most peasants belonged to the Pure Land sect, they tended to take the side of the sect when conflicts arose. This was especially the case with the Ikkô-shû lineage which was growing ever more popular. Local ikki often threw their support behind the Ikkô-shû in their feuds with other sects - sometimes even taking it upon themselves to start a feud!"

 dg_mahayana.049.d:1 "The abbot of the Pure Land sect has been receiving missives complaining about the Ikkô-shû lineage. The Pure Land sect was sympathetic to the plight of the lower classes in the current period of instability, but the Ikkô-shû were going farther by sponsoring peasant self-defence leagues (Ikki). These Ikki were founded to protect villagers from bandits and armies, but now there are reports of them taking sides in monastic feuds and even attacking the temples of other sects! Naturally, this was to the benefit of the Pure Land sect - but it was also dangerous and unpopular. There were growing demands for the abbot to bring the Ikkô-shû to heel - either by ordering other Pure Land Buddhists to shun them (hamon) or ordering their execution (shôgai)."

When peasants formed Ikkis (self-defence leagues) to protect themselves, the Ikkô-shû gave them their whole-hearted support, transforming monasteries into fortresses - and using the Ikki as their own private armies in feuds with other sects. This alarming trend has finally forced the abbot of the sect to excommunicate the order."

This gave the orders considerable prestige, but it also required constant vigilance. If a monk was found to be corrupt or even just felt he had failed his vows, his ordination was revoked - along with that of all monks he had personally ordained. In such cases monks had to seek out the blessings of another member of the same order. This was usually not a problem, but when an order shrank in size, it could be difficult to find another with the same lineage. In such cases, entire orders could be disbanded.

Young boys, and sometimes girls, were dressed in fine robes and paraded around town before being delivered to a monastery where they had their heads shaved and fine robes exchanged for the simple saffron robes of a monk. There, they made ten vows and lived among the monks for a short time - as little as a week, or as long as the full two years of an initiate monk. After that, they returned to their regular lives.\n\nEven royalty took part in this coming of age ritual, with many a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] able to claim to have once been a monk.

Although Tibetan princes reclaimed control of their country by 1354, it was clear that the sects were no longer merely spiritual entities.

Gelug or 'Yellow Hat' Buddhism emerged in the fourteenth century, emphasising logic and scholarship, while the Karma Kagyu or 'Black Hat' sect appeared in the eleventh century and emphasised meditation and singlemindedness.

Now our monks have presented the $MONARCHTITLE$ with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own copy.\n\nThe eventual goal of all Buddhists was to break the cycle of death and rebirth and attain Nirvana. However, this goal was so difficult that most Buddhists felt it was unattainable. Having concrete signs to look for, dreams to interpret and actions they could take was a great relief to many Buddhists who fully expected to be reborn again.

Should we add them to the canon?\n\nAccording to Vajrayana traditions, many Buddhas dictated sacred stories then hid them until their disciples were reborn again as Treasure-Finders (Terton) when their spiritual messages were needed. Many young monks were eager to reveal such a treasure but actual discoveries were few and far between. A cynic might wonder if the scrolls were not actually penned by the discoverer himself, then planted in a cache to be miraculously found later.

Until the end of the Muromachi period, one of the emperor's most important roles was to pay tribute to the spirits (heihaku) and go on pilgrimages to the most important shrines (sankei) once a year to pray for rain, good harvests and victory in battle. After the imperial system broke down, provincial governors and daimyo took on this role, paying tribute to the spirits and making annual pilgrimages to 'ichinomiya' (first shrines, or the most important in each province) where the kami (spirits) of each province were gathered to observe the rituals."

Said to be the home of the sun goddess Amaterasu, Ise Shrine was established by emperor Temmu in the seventh century, quickly becoming an important symbol of imperial legitimacy. A member of the imperial family managed it as high priest from then until the imperial family split into two in the fourteenth century. After that, Ise Shrine fell into a decline and lost much of its purpose. Despite this, it remained the centre of Ise Shintô, one of the most influential Shintô sects."

Buddhist sutras were dedicated to the spirits, who were each assigned a role in Buddhism, often as protectors of the Buddhas. The sun goddess Amaterasu, for example, was seen as a manifestation of the Buddha Mahavairocana. This blending of the two, or 'Shin-Butsu Shūgō', persisted from the Nara period until $YEAR$, when it came to be replaced by what would be known as $DYNASTY$ or 'Yuiitsu Shintô' - the One-and-Only Shintô.\n\nIt was a period of great uncertainty; many of the imperial court's Shintô rituals had come to a halt due to lack of funds, the destruction of shrines, or the breakdown of order. An official of the Ministry for Shintô Affairs, $THEOLOGIAN$, took advantage of the chaos to develop an entirely new Shintô theology which reversed the status quo, claiming that the Buddhas were manifestations of the spirits. He emphasised that humans belonged to the ranks of spirits and promoted new rituals that promised magical power to intercessors. All of this rode roughshod over tradition, but it spread like wildfire among the peasants, especially after he established both a professional caste of Shintô priests and a rotating lay priesthood in each village."

Shintô was especially popular among the peasants, and Japanese rulers used rituals to encourage loyalty and maintain the divine status of the imperial family."
