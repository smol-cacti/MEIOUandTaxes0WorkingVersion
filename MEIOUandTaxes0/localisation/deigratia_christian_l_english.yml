 dg_catholic.001.t:1 "Simony"
 dg_catholic.001.d:1 "Thanks to bequests by pious worshippers, church titles came with land and an income for their holders. By the fifteenth century, an archbishop could rival a prince in power! Over the centuries, this resulted in nobility trafficking in church titles in order to secure the lands attached to a bishopric or two. Few peasants could afford to pay such a price, so gradually the upper echelons of the church became full of aristocrats whose sympathies lay with their own kind."

 dg_catholic.002.t:1 "Absentee Bishop of $PROVINCENAME$"
 dg_catholic.002.d:1 "Thanks to bequests by pious worshippers, church titles brought income and property to their holders. The more valuable dioceses were coveted prizes and some priests or bishops bribed their way to having two or more benefices. To fulfil their duties on these far-off estates, clerics would hire local replacements and pocket the difference. Often untrained and sometimes incapable of even speaking Latin, these replacement priests caused many problems, up to and including spreading heresy!"

 dg_catholic.003.t:1 "The Bishop's Mistress"
 dg_catholic.003.d:1 "The new bishop of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ is making waves among his parishioners, having just moved into his offices along with his mistress and children. This is upsetting pious Catholics in $PROVINCENAME$, who are openly wondering if such a wicked man can truly claim to speak with God's authority.\n\nIn an attempt to keep priests from attempting to pass their benefices to their sons, the Catholic Church banned priests from marrying in 1059 AD. Rather than putting an end to the practise, it merely drove it underground. Many priests were uneducated peasants who found abstinence to be challenging, and it was common practise for parish priests to have a 'housekeeper' living with him - and sometimes 'nephews' who bore a striking resemblance to the priest himself. Such disregard for their vows made many Catholics doubt the sanctity of the sacraments the priests offered them. This was bad enough, but to have a bishop do the same was a slap in the face. It was usually ignored, though, since rulers often treated bishoprics as a convenient position for second-born sons."

 dg_catholic.004.t:1 "Indulgence Peddler in $PROVINCENAME$"
 dg_catholic.004.d:1 "A travelling monk is passing through $PROVINCENAME$, authorised by the church to stop at villages and towns and offer forgiveness of sins to people for a price.\n\nCatholics who sinned needed to go through a process to find forgiveness: first they had to repent the sin, then they had to confess it to a priest, and finally they had to do penance - good works such as pilgrimages or fasting in order to make up for the evil they had done. An indulgence was a way to bypass doing penance by getting the church to bless you with some of the grace of dead saints. Unscrupulous indulgence peddlers went much further, promising that indulgences meant you didn't have to go to confession, that they could allow the dead to escape purgatory, even that they could be used to forgive sins that people had not yet committed! Pious theologians were horrified at these claims but credulous peasants bought them up rapidly. Soon a steady flow of gold passed into the hands of such peddlers, to be split between them, the archbishops who had authorised it, and the pope himself."

 dg_catholic.005.t:1 "Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction"
 dg_catholic.005.d:1 "During the middle ages the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ church policed itself, with its own independent laws and courts. Ecclesiastical (church) courts tended to be more lenient than secular ones; crimes that normally resulted in the execution of the guilty, such as sodomy or bestiality, resulted in sentences of pilgrimages or public confession instead. Over time, anyone who could claim clerical status in any way - such as university students, who were technically clergy - asked to be tried in an ecclesiastical court. While perfectly legal, it was not popular with the public if a heinous crime was punished lightly, nor with rulers if they could not execute a troublesome opponent. At times, the $MONARCHTITLE$ would become personally involved in a case to ensure that the accused did not receive a church trial. Religious leaders protested when this happened but were largely impotent to do anything."
 dg_catholic.005.a:1 "Submit to church authority"
 dg_catholic.005.b:1 "Sentence them under secular law"
 dg_catholic.006.t:1 "Popular Piety"
 dg_catholic.006.d:1 "The distractions of the Catholic Church in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries meant that ordinary Catholics felt a longing for connection with their faith that was not being met in church. Instead, many people found ways to devote themselves to God in direct, tangible ways.\n\nThis manifested as a revival of interest in spiritual traditions like pilgrimages, joining Confraternities, participating in Passion plays and venerating saints and relics. It also inspired new practises such as praying the Rosary, venerating Mary during mass, taking up the Stations of the Cross and purchasing indulgences. In Northern Europe, pious women joined communities of Beguines - women who did not join a nunnery, but who lived life as if they had. Like-minded men joined the Brethren of the Common Life. Religious art increasingly aimed at making holy figures seem human, emotional and approachable.\n\nPopular piety was a religious revival, but it took place outside the hierarchical church and sometimes went against its teachings. The Catholic Church tolerated these minor deviations and eventually incorporated most of them as official doctrine over the next several centuries, but at the time, it was controversial within the Church."
 dg_catholic.006.a:1 "Encourage these practises"
 dg_catholic.006.b:1 "Forbid these practises"
 dg_catholic.007.t:1 "Birth of the Conciliar Movement"
 dg_catholic.007.d:1 "In the early thirteenth century, some canon lawyers speculated what to do if a pope became a heretic, and concluded that ultimate power rested in the hands of the church itself, as embodied in an ecumenical council. Meant as an exercise in theory, it gained serious attention during the schism as rival popes split the church. Witnessing the election of rival popes, the unwillingness of popes to cede power, and the politics of the Curia, frustrated church leaders looked for a rival authority that could call a church council. They found one in the example of Emperor Constantine calling the Council of Nicaea, and looked to the modern example of the Holy Roman Emperor to unite the church.\n\nMany church leaders and laity became convinced that church councils were not only good, but necessary. Rather than be led by popes with human frailties, they believed that the whole church should meet on a regular basis. Inevitably, this Conciliar movement would come into conflict with the popes, who guarded their authority jealously."

 dg_catholic.013.d:1 "Men and women who felt a special calling gave up their secular lives and devoted themselves to their faith. There were many different types of monks, but during the Renaissance most belonged to four orders: §BAugustinian§! monks farmed and devoted themselves to charity, §BCistercian§! monks sought contemplation of God through splendid isolation on their monasteries in which they produced everything they needed, §BDominican§! friars travelled the land seeking out blasphemy and heresy, and §BFranciscan§! friars deliberately surrounded themselves by poverty in order to help others and preach repentance. Over time, some of these groups fell into decline, either due to theological division, losing their sense of purpose, or a lack of royal support."

 dg_catholic.021.d:1 "Saints were an important part of the Catholic church. When particularly holy men or women had miracles ascribed to them, they could be canonised (made a saint). This was not a common practise, and when it happened places and things associated with the saint in life often became objects of veneration.

 dg_catholic.022.d:1 "When a particularly holy man or woman died, there was often a movement to have them recognised as a saint. The church recognised this temptation and made the process a slow one, requiring them to first be beatified, or recognised as having led a holy life, before witnesses could be brought forward to speak of the miracles they had witnessed. Since this process could take years or decades, princes and bishops sometimes lobbied the papacy to have a local hero sainted."

 dg_catholic.023.d:1 "Throughout the middle ages, social mobility was extremely limited even in relatively enlightened states. One of the few avenues to wealth and power available to everyone was the clergy. While the highest ranks of the church tended to be dominated by the nobility, occasionally the son of a farmer or goatherd rose to the rank of bishop or cardinal. When this happened it was cause for celebration in his hometown - walking proof that it was possible for the lowliest peasant to walk among kings."

With relations crumbling between our countries, their ruler has proposed a solution to the issues dividing us before they erupt into a feud.

Already thousands of true believers are flocking to the site to pray for her intercession with her Son, establishing a shrine to her there.\n\nAlthough the Church taught that the age of direct revelation had ended with the Apostles, it still believed that personal revelation was possible.

 dg_catholic.032.d:1 "The $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ inquisition sought out heresy and blasphemy in $COUNTRY$. When it found sinners it tried them using witness testimony and torture to extract confessions. If convicted, defendants would be given penance to restore them to a state of grace. This ranged from public confession or pilgrimages overseas all the way to becoming a monk or being burned at the stake. Nearly all the time, a sinner who confessed his guilt was spared the ultimate penalty, instead being burned in effigy. However, unrepentant heretics and those who were caught a second time could be sentenced to death. The inquisition had no authority to do so, however, and so such prisoners were handed over to the civil authorities who carried out the executions. All of this would take place in a carefully orchestrated event in which thousands of prisoners convicted over the previous months would be brought to a public square to confess their guilt and begin their penance, culminating in the burning of effigies or the execution of heretics. This 'Auto da fe' was a public spectacle that helped to maintain religious unity and demonstrate the power of the inquisition."

 dg_catholic.033.d:1 "The Jesuits were a monastic order who were fanatically devoted to the pope. Seeing themselves as the soldiers of Christ, they fought back against the Reformation by establishing colleges and seminaries that could educate a generation of missionaries and priests who could debate Reformers on an equal footing.\n\nThe Society preferred to educate and work closely with Catholic rulers of the countries they were involved in. Having the blessing of the ruler gave the Jesuits legitimacy and sometimes preferential treatment while rooting out heresy in their lands, and staying close to the ruler meant less chance of another Reformation. To this end, the Jesuits had an interest in maintaining or even increasing the authority of the $MONARCHTITLE$. Many rulers employed a Jesuit Confessor whose role was not only a spiritual advisor, but also a political and economic advisor as well."

 dg_catholic.036.d:1 "For centuries the Catholic church struggled with secular rulers for supremacy in the Investiture controversy. The victor would gain the right to appoint bishops to their benefices, which meant having the loyalty of the clergy as well as the tithes paid by them. In the early modern era, rulers also began restricting the privileges of the clergy. All this was a thorn in the side of the papacy, and popes spent a great deal of effort trying to convince the $MONARCHTITLE$ to restore papal sovereignty over $COUNTRY$.

At first the list contained only theological treatises, but as time went on it grew to include humanist philosophy, political tracts and even racy novels. Forbidden books could often be obtained despite the laws, smuggled into Catholic countries with their price driven up dramatically. It was not unheard of for a book to rise in value ten times once it was put on a list!

Especially pious lords and those near the conflict took up arms, but most sent token forces or ignored the calls entirely.

Not all are holy men; although many joined the crusade for noble reasons, others simply hoped to win a fortune, and some were even escaping justice at home. All of them caused problems: the fanatics who arrived could be upset at what they saw as a lack of piety; the opportunists expected to pillage when they won victories - even when liberating Christians; the ones escaping justice at home believed they had dispensation for any crimes from the pope - past or future.

Although in theory secular princes had no say over the affairs of the church, in practise their cooperation was essential for a council to be called without casting doubt on its legitimacy. This meant that it was crucial to find a site that was acceptable to the great powers - or at least not in thrall to their enemies. Unfortunately, this could be difficult in times of strife.

 dg_catholic.076.t:1 "Consanguinity"
 dg_catholic.076.d:1 "For both moral and physical reasons, the church forbade marriage to those within seven degrees of separation from each other - as distant as third cousins. This encouraged villagers to travel and marry in other areas and helped avoid many hereditary defects, but it was also quite complex to keep track of genealogy, so the rule resulted in many broken engagements and annulled marriages. Over the last few months, our ambassadors have worked tirelessly to arrange a royal marriage between a prince of our nation and a princess of one of our neighbours in the hopes of cementing good relations with them. Our work has borne fruit, and the engagement was announced, only to discover the couple is distantly related by blood.

This provided bishops with an income, which made the position more lucrative and more tempting for noble sons, but it also increased the poverty of the average priest and so drove educated middle-class men away from priesthood. Since the bishops themselves also paid the annate, it also encouraged bishops to tax the peasants on their land heavily, leading many peasants to see the church as no better than any other baron or duke. In $YEAR$ the church officially abolished the practise of paying the annate.\n\nThis will significantly cut down on simony events."

It was not unheard of for priests to simply mumble their way through the mass, with their congregation equally unaware he was not speaking the right words! Obviously these priests were also unlikely to make good preachers, and religious education in general suffered. Not only was this incompetence, it could lead to outright heresy.\n\nIn $YEAR$ the church set out clear rules and standards for clerical education and began establishing seminaries across Europe for that purpose.\n\nThis will significantly cut down on absenteeism events."

Wealthy families sometimes paid for two or more benefices for the same man - often leagues apart. This helped raise their standard of living, but of course no one man could live in two places at the same time. In many cases they appointed a salaried replacement who was simply not up to the duties required.

Technically priests were not supposed to have children since they were celibate, but it was all too common for a priest or bishop to keep a concubine, and then introduce their children as nephews and nieces who could not inherit their father's estates directly, so instead received church positions or favours.

They hoped their efforts would spread Christianity, but their missions also helped open relations with their homelands - as long as they were tolerated.

Instead, it was often the black-robed Jesuit monks who became the ambassadors of the West.\n\nBelieving that other faiths might also reflect God's purpose, these monks made an effort to learn local languages and adopt local dress and customs.

They also showed off their learning and offered free schooling to the children of elites in the hopes of gaining powerful converts.\n\nDespite these tactics, their efforts bore few fruits.

Later missionaries belonged to the rival Dominican and Franciscan orders of monks. They resented Jesuit influence and considered their methods to be heretical and their upper class targets to be against the example of Christ. They reacted by aggressively proselytizing among the lower classes and actively opposing local customs, attacking temples and making outrageous demands. Their actions were met with a mixture of shock and anger. Soon outraged locals were beating and killing Christians in response, and blood ran down the streets."

Forced to farm to survive, they proved to be exceptional farmers who were willing to experiment. Monks were often at the forefront of agricultural innovations such as the horse collar, three-field system, or New World crops.\n\nDespite these obvious gains, many peasants fiercely rejected change. Their relationship with their lords was set not in law but in centuries of local custom.

In addition, the Devil was constantly trying to tempt men away from the righteous path. To fight this demonic influence and lead people back to the true path, some monks preached that people needed to rid themselves of anything that kept them from God. Luxuries such as perfume or fancy dresses, books that spoke of humanist doctrines or romance, and art that portrayed heathen or salacious themes were all considered sinful - and so burning them publicly in a 'bonfire of the vanities' became a popular way to repent.

Some saw it as their holy duty to work among the sick, slaves and the poor. Occasionally, some took this calling to extremes - taking up the cause of the downtrodden, and even taking part in revolts!

While all monks of an order followed the same rules, there were often great differences in how they interpreted them, and in what they did that was not explicitly spelled out in the canons of the order.

Early monks lived alone, scratching out an ascetic existence in the wilderness in order to devote themselves entirely to God. Such §Ghermits§! unwittingly became the object of pilgrimage, as pious worshippers sought them out for advice and blessings. Other monks known as §GCenobites§! lived together in small monasteries, farming and praying together. These communities ironically formed the nucleus of small towns as peasants sought to colonise new land nearby. In more settled areas, monasteries were sometimes founded in close proximity to each other, forming a large community known as a §Glavra§!. Lavras controlled vast swaths of land and used their wealth to act as charities.

Many new churches and monasteries were founded; at the same time, many people noticed with unease how wealthy the church was becoming. Two opposing movements emerged: Non-Possessors believed that purity of heart was more important than knowledge of the liturgy and condemned the growing power of the monasteries. Possessors believed that monasteries were centres of learning and prayer, and encouraged more to be built. Both sides claimed prominent monks, and despite their differences, agreed on most issues of doctrine.\n\nAlthough the Non-Possessor movement had many supporters among the peasants, the Possessor movement was more popular with royalty. Endowing monasteries was a traditional way for a ruler to show his piety, and monasteries spread a message of loyalty to the ruler. While some princes supported the Non-Possessors, perhaps as a pretext to seizing land from the church, but most agreed to persecute them."

This inspired a movement called the Judaizer heresy. Proponents believed that the Trinity was a false doctrine that had crept into the church, opposed the veneration of icons as idolatry, and condemned monks for their greed. The movement intensified with the Protestant Reformation in the West, as Orthodox Christians witnessed the systematic dismantling of monasteries there. Although some rulers supported the Judaizers, probably as a weapon against the church, most were alarmed by it and agreed to persecute it."

Holy Fools such as Symeon the New Theologian, Ioann Big Cap, or Basil the Blessed shocked society with their antics: walking around naked, throwing nuts at women during services, carrying around dead animals, insulting the people they met - and more heretical deeds, such as idolizing their teachers or, in so doing, they mocked the rule-bound, solemn Orthodox religion. But rather than be condemned by the church, holy fools were considered to be sacred. In mocking society, they gave critics an outlet for their frustration and so reinforced the rules they detested.

Beginning as a Great Lavras, it quickly expanded as other monks speaking other languages arrived at the mountain and built their own monasteries, until it became a community of Orthodox monks. This allowed them to share ideas and prayers, contributing greatly to Orthodox doctrine. After the battle of Manzikert, it was left as the only remaining holy mountain, a site of pilgrimages and hermitages. Despite its importance, Mt. Athos was a small community that didn't bother anyone, and conquerors often found it more expedient to let the monks continue to live their lives than bother to disperse them."

This time, however, the patriarch appears determined to purge the Orthodox Church of $COUNTRY$ - he has defrocked priests who remarried, monks whose beliefs smacked of heresy, even bishops - and many Orthodox priests are upset! One bishop has written to us, asking us to 'liberate our bishops from the slavery of the Patriarchs'.\n\nOur Jesuit advisors believe this gives us an opportunity to unite the churches.

Every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ diocese was headed by a bishop who accepted the Union of $CAPITAL_CITY$. But despite this, resistance to the union continued. Orthodox monks complained that the union gave no role to the Ecumenical Patriarch, and some condemned their leadership for betraying them. In turn, the state church continued to persecute those Orthodox Christians who refused the union, forbidding them from burying their dead in graveyards taken over by the Uniate church and forbidding them from positions of authority. Tensions rose high in $YEAR$ with the murder of a Catholic priest, as mob violence threatened to break out in $COUNTRY$.\n\nModerates on both sides have presented us with a proposal: We could recognise the Orthodox hierarchy as a separate church, subject to the Filioque, but independent of the Catholic authorities.

Many on both sides hated the schism and hoped to one day heal it - but with each passing century, it seemed less of a possibility. On what terms could it be done?\n\nThe answer has come to us in the form of a group of Catholic monks, bearing an offer to unite the churches - the same deal accepted by more than one Byzantine ruler in the dying days of the empire. Accept papal authority, unleavened Eucharist bread, the existence of purgatory and the filioque doctrine. In return, Orthodox priests would be allowed to marry and practise their liturgy the way they had done for centuries. While such a Uniate church was tempting to Orthodox Christians living in Catholic countries, it was a slap in the face to fiercely independent Orthodox patriarchs."

In $YEAR$ the pope saw the chance to reunite the Christian churches by arranging her marriage with the house of $DYNASTY$.

With the decline and fall of Constantinople, the Orthodox world was revealed to be weak and disunited. It needed a champion, a nation that could defend it as Rome had done for so long. Casting about for a successor, a lowly monk could not help but notice the growing power of $COUNTRY$, and in $YEAR$ wrote to the $MONARCHTITLE$:\n\n'Two Romes have fallen, the Third stands - and there shall not be a fourth.'\n\nFrom that point on, $MONARCH$ added a new title to $RULER_ADJ$ list: by the grace of God, Tsar, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ term for the Latin 'Caesar', Emperor of Rome."

 dg_orthodox.053.d:1 "Orthodox Christianity had long clung to the idea that the Romans had nurtured and protected their faith. The emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire enjoyed a particular sanctity in the church, as did any successor who could claim to have his authority. At the same time, church history taught that, in his last days, Constantine the Great signed over the empire to the Patriarch of Rome, recorded in the Donation of Constantine. When these two ideas were combined, it could be interpreted that the Patriarch should be superior to the $MONARCHTITLE$.\n\nSaying this about the church was scandal enough, but the Patriarch is going even farther: he maintains that the Patriarch should be superior to the $MONARCHTITLE$ even in secular authority and riches! This is a challenge to our authority that must be answered."

 dg_orthodox.061.d:1 "In $COUNTRY$, Christian doctrine was less important than Christian practise. Popular religion was based on the liturgical calendar and its local rituals, many of which predated the arrival of Christianity. Much of it was designed to be celebratory without much connection to Christ.\n\nThe Patriarch has called on the church to discard these practises, encouraging priests to smash tambourines and masks and abduct dancing bears. In so doing, he has upset many people who enjoyed the festivities, including a number of outspoken monks. Now he looks to the $MONARCHTITLE$ to provide support for this reform."

 dg_orthodox.062.d:1 "As Greek texts began being published in Europe, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monks began noticing disturbing facts. The Greeks had continued to develop their theology in a way that $COUNTRY$ had not, and by $YEAR$ there were considerable differences in their liturgy. Not only did these errors prevent unity in the worldwide Orthodox church, they also suggested that $COUNTRY$'s church was backwards.\n\nThe Patriarch has called on the church to adopt these new liturgical practises, and has declared the old texts to be anathema."

 dg_orthodox.063.t:1 "Modernising the Church"
 dg_orthodox.063.d:1 "There was considerable opposition to the adoption of the new liturgy in $COUNTRY$. In part it was because the clergy resisted change, and in part it was because few clergy were trained in the new Greek texts. In order to implement these reforms, the Patriarch has begun appointing only monks trained in the Greek liturgy to positions of authority in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ church. This has resulted in opposition from within the church, both because it passes up monks who might otherwise make good administrators, and because monks trained in the Greek fashion are more likely to be tainted by contact with heresy."

 dg_orthodox.064.d:1 "In $COUNTRY$ there were two kinds of clergy: White-robed priests and black-robed monks. Priests were allowed to marry, while monks were required to be celibate. Over the centuries, this resulted in hereditary families of parish priests who remained in one village all their lives, often lacking much education. In contrast, bishops were nearly always chosen from the ranks of the highly educated and often wealthy monks. This created resentment of the monks by the whites and derision of the priests by the blacks.\n\nTo heal this division in the church, the Patriarch has proposed that the $MONARCHTITLE$ sponsor nation-wide seminaries and require all children of priests to attend clerical training in order to be better prepared for their future careers."

There were not enough jobs to go around, so some children inevitably ended up looking for work elsewhere. These frustrated, over-educated young men could be fierce critics of both the church and the $MONARCHTITLE$. To make matters worse, some of the children of priests are lackluster at best, seeing the profession as a family business rather than a higher calling."

 dg_orthodox.066.d:1 "In many ways, Orthodox Christianity turned in on itself, seeking change only to become closer to tradition. With each new reform to the church, more and more of the faithful began to see the church as having lost its way. Even high-ranking bishops criticised the Patriarch openly, until they had to be silenced.\n\nIn the end, the straw that broke the camel's back was trivial: the Patriarch called on worshippers to make the sign of the cross using three fingers, to represent the holy trinity, instead of two fingers, representing the two natures of Christ. Thousands demonstrated against the changes, and, declaring themselves true Christians, formed their own churches which allowed them to practise their traditional ways. These new churches broke the unity of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ church."

Who should be in charge?\n\nThe Council of Nicaea established for the first time the authority of the Patriarchs of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch. Constantinople was added to this number in the Council of Constantinople - but at the same time, Rome was officially established as the First Among Equals among the Patriarchs, to be consulted on any important theological issue. This primacy was acknowledged by several Roman Emperors in law - and then used by the Patriarchs of Rome to lead the Western Church into heresy and rivalry for a millennium. It should come as no surprise, then, that our Ecumenical Patriarch has protested the appointment of his fellow Patriarch in Rome. Are we handing Rome authority over [Root.Owner.GetName]?"

A disputation, or formal debate, was a traditional way to resolve religious differences within the Catholic church, and some rulers sponsored one, scouring the land for reformers and proponents of the church to hold a public disputation.

Sometimes, a spouse could be old, ugly, a drunkard, or just plain mean. Rulers trapped in such loveless marriages generally had few options - they could seek a divorce from the pope and risk both a scandal and alienating their spouse's powerful family, or they could have affairs on the side and risk having bastard children that could cause problems with the succession. For $MONARCH$, however, the exciting new $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith offered up another option. The faith emphasised using the Bible to support theology, and in the Old Testament, several kings and patriarchs practised polygamy. This would allow the $MONARCHTITLE$ to keep their original spouse and take another legally, eliminating the problem of bastards. In a series of letters written to $THEOLOGIAN$, $MONARCH$ argued for this course of action, and, against his better judgement, $THEOLOGIAN$ reluctantly agreed that it could be done. Yet this scandal might bring great shame upon the nascent $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ church, and upon $COUNTRY$. Is it worth it to have your cake and eat it, too?"

Many rulers gradually loosened the grip of the Catholic church with a series of laws designed to weaken it and play to the strengths of Protestantism. At the same time, rulers favoured theologians and courtiers who supported the new faith and criticised the church.

In order to find unity, Protestant churches established Articles of Faith that clarified their beliefs. Often, a losing side would leave the church rather than give up their doctrine.

During times of great upheaval witch trials could lead to mass hysteria and mob lynchings when a court found in the defendant's favour or where the law could not or would not be enforced.

In an attempt to create a more cohesive faith, Protestant countries went through the process of codifying books of theology and prayer that were considered to be canon.

The pope was not God's chosen leader, but perhaps he could be seen as a fallible leader chosen by pious men.

This gave the movement tremendous appeal among Catholics during the Reformation, but it had unexpected side effects. Over time, generations of Protestants applied reason to holy scripture and began to lose faith in the church. This process was different in each country. In some, the church gradually became impotent, with the common man looking into spiritualism and the occult to satisfy his hunger for faith. In some, revival movements sprang up to combat this trend. In the rest, the governments passed laws designed to keep the state church's influence strong."

Division among Protestants, losses against other faiths and without a place for women as nuns all contributed to a general feeling of isolation from their faith in Protestant countries.\n\nThis was especially a problem in university towns, which were growing too rapidly for the existing church hierarchy to accommodate. Theologians and preachers cast about for ideas, especially from the Reformed churches and Counter-Reform Jesuits who were inspiring such fervour in their own lands. A new movement called Pietism attempted to use their methods with the theology of the Church of $COUNTRY$.\n\nPreachers gave open-air sermons to the public, composed new hymns using popular music, incorporated laity in the functions of the church, and channelled activists into voluntary societies that did missionary work and enforced public morality.

Some preachers saw a state church as a betrayal of the Reformation and wanted to restore the church to its original purity, free from entanglements with the government. They defined the church as made up only of people who willingly joined it, and free from government support or interference. To this end, they called for an end to enforced military service, payment of church tithes, and infant baptism, and demanded that church-goers govern themselves rather than follow a church hierarchy.\n\nAll of these were radical ideas, but the most radical of all was the idea that only adults should be baptized. By baptizing infants, not only was religious unity enforced, but civil society could better keep track of the population.

They believed that only willing believers should join the church and baptized members as adults when they joined rather than as infants - a practise which has no biblical support. They believed that the church and state should be separate, and that the church had no right to punish people for their religious beliefs. Anabaptists were pacifists who refused to fight - even in self-defence against the people persecuting their faith.\n\nAll this made the Anabaptists anathema to most rulers, who saw their faith as a direct attack on the state church...which in many ways, it was."

His Anabaptist followers swiftly rose up and occupied the city, re-baptizing the citizenry into their faith and expelling those who refused.\n\nThe forces of the $MONARCHTITLE$ quickly responded, leading to the movement becoming more and more radical until the bitter end, when the siege was broken and the rebels hung in cages until they starved.

 dg_reformation.005.t:1 "The [reformation_origins_disputation.Capital.GetName] Disputation"
 dg_reformation.005.d:1 "The recent publication of the Ninety-Five Theses criticising the Church has stirred up a stinging reaction in [reformation_origins.Owner.GetName]. The Pope himself sent a representative to correct its mistakes, while its author - a [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] monk from [reformation_origins.GetName] - was invited to give his reply. Both men believing in the righteousness of their cause, they agreed to hold a debate in [reformation_origins_disputation.GetName] Castle in view of [reformation_origins_disputation.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [reformation_origins_disputation.Owner.Monarch.GetName], with masters from theological universities to act as neutral judges.\n\nThe debate itself lasted for weeks. The [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] monk argued that there was no Biblical evidence that Purgatory existed and that the Pope did not have the authority to offer Indulgences. The Roman legate pressed the monk to acknowledge the authority of the Pope over the Church until finally the monk admitted that the Pope had no such authority: 'I deny that he is above scripture.'\n\nThis statement was a tacit admission of heresy, if not an outright declaration of war against the Church. In the end, neither man budged from his initial position, and both declared victory in the debate as they returned to their homes."
 dg_reformation.005.a:1 "Wait and see what happens"

 dg_reformation.006.university:1 "\nTheologians from our university are mulling over the debate in order to make their verdict. It may be prudent to see how the Pope reacts first, however."
 dg_reformation.007.t:1 "Exsurge Domine"
 dg_reformation.007.d:1 "The Pope has sent us copies of a Papal Bull and ordered our bishops to post it in public. This is nothing new, but the reaction is! Supporters of the [reformation_origins.Culture.GetName] monk who posted the Ninety-Five Theses recently have begun tearing the Bull down and even attacking the priests who post it!\n\nThe Bull - named after its opening phrase, Arise O Lord (Exsurge Domine) announces that the Ninety-Five Theses are in fact heresy, and gives its author sixty days to recant or face excommunication from the Church. Until now, the monk could claim to be trying to reform the Church from within. Now, however, it leaves him with a stark choice: abandon his beliefs or his Church. Which way will he and his followers decide? The riots so far suggest the answer."
 dg_reformation.007.a:1 "Send soldiers to protect the priests"
 dg_reformation.007.b:1 "Do not intervene in ecclesiastical matters"
 dg_reformation.007.luther:1 "Indeed, it comes as no surprise when he publicly gave his answer: to call the Bull the work of the Antichrist and burn it, to the cheers of hundreds. It seems that there is no stopping this now, and God protect [Root.GetName]."

Sending the reformer to Rome would mean sending him to his death - and would be seen as a betrayal by the monk's [Root.GetAdjective] supporters. Holding a trial in [Root.Country.GetName] would place the blame even more squarely on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s shoulders.

While the Pope was the supreme authority over the Church, he still acted within the limits of the Church - and that meant appealing to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to punish heretics within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] domain. To do otherwise was to suggest limits to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority and power as well as to potentially invite excommunication or crusades against the heretics!"

However, the situation in $COUNTRY$ was still delicate; although Lollardy had inspired revolt among the peasantry, it inspired dreams of centralising government among the nobility, and still had powerful supporters.

The pope hinted darkly that unless the $MONARCHTITLE$ agreed to persecute the Hussites, the church might have to call a crusade to set things right."

To that end, they promulgated four articles which set out a set of demands. They demanded the right to preach Lollardy, separating church and state, removing the special privileges that the nobility enjoyed, and allowing worshippers to take communion in both kinds, the bread and cup of Christ. It was this last point that made the movement into a heresy, and it gave them the name 'Calixtine'.\n\nThe Hussites of $CAPITAL_CITY$ represented a moderate, even conservative reform movement made up of nobles, merchants and craftsmen who lived in urban centres. Although they were heavily influenced by Lollardy, they were willing to accept the church hierarchy and the $MONARCHTITLE$ so long as their other demands were met. They wanted to reform the church and believed that restoring it to apostolic poverty, and giving the $MONARCHTITLE$ power over it, was the way to do so.

Ordinary peasants were attracted to Lollard criticism of the church's luxuries and corruption and eagerly took up the call to share in both bread and wine of communion, seeing it as an issue of equality. For many, however, the doctrines of the Hussite League simply did not go far enough. They were Millenarians who believed that the Kingdom of God was upon them, and they wanted to establish it through force if necessary. They did not want merely to reform the church, they wanted to start from scratch. The radicals demanded equality for all, sharing private property, putting an end to rents, abolishing laws that differentiated between classes, and getting rid of the clergy altogether, replacing them with unpaid, elected leaders.\n\nThese radicals were soon driven out of the towns by their neighbours. Seeking a place of refuge, they founded a new settlement along a river, calling it 'Tabor' after the mountain upon which Jesus Christ was prophesied to return to Earth. These Taborites, and similar groups, made up the radical wing of the Hussite movement - fanatical, desperate and numerous."

This made it popular, both amongst the aristocracy and the peasantry. However, it quickly grew beyond reform into clear heresy, denying the authority of the pope, declaring communion to be symbolic, and seeking biblical support for church doctrines."

Eventually, they found a candidate who promised to allow them to practise their religion and offered the crown to him.

Accepting would be like receiving our crown from the gutter; it would send a message to the other crowned heads of Europe that we support this kind of revolution. In addition, it could conceivably create a rival for our own throne, in the same way that the Duke of Normandy became a rival to the King of France.\n\nWorse than anything else, though, is the news that our royal cousin has already accepted the offer, and is already on his way there as we speak..."

In the end, the Romanists agreed to give the right to partake in both the bread and wine of communion and allowed public preaching of Lollardy. In return, the Hussites would recognise the pope's authority to appoint priests and would swear loyalty to $MONARCH$, who in return would swear an oath of loyalty to protect the rights of the burghers, Hussites and Catholics.

Miaphysites preferred to use Coptic, the ancient language of Egypt that they were most familiar with. The original split between Orthodox and Miaphysite was exacerbated by this difference, since the word 'nature' so key to understanding the two is slightly different in Coptic than it is in Greek. Having a shared language would prevent this sort of problem from happening again. Allowing two languages opens the door for a cacophony of languages to be spoken, each with a differing interpretation of the scriptures. However, it would also open the door to people sharing the gospels more easily.\n\nWith the blessing of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Patriarch $THEOLOGIAN$ has answered this thorny question by saying:"

After the Muslim conquest, each church established its own patriarch for each of the seats, maintaining a line of succession that has lasted down the ages until today. If we are serious about uniting the churches, however, we cannot have rival patriarchs!\n\nWith the blessing of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Patriarch $THEOLOGIAN$ has answered this thorny question by saying:"

 dg_miaphysite.013.d:1 "Some of the issues dividing Orthodox and Miaphysite were purely theological, including a critical one: should the church condemn bishops who had supported Nestorius?\n\nNestorius was the Patriarch of Constantinople in the fifth century until his heresy led him to being condemned at the Council of Ephesus - the last church council which both Orthodox and Miaphysite Christians agreed on. However, the Miaphysites felt that the Orthodox church was flirting with heresy when it failed to condemn three church leaders who had supported Nestorius - although in at least two cases, due in large part to translation errors. The Orthodox church later agreed to do so in an attempt to reunite the churches in 544, only to suffer schism anew as several bishops left the church over the issue. The problem was that by condemning these men for this single issue it also condemned their support of the Council of Chalcedon - and laid open the possibility of condemning saints who had been mistaken about other topics. Yet by approving their words, it meant tacitly approving heresy.\n\nWith the blessing of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Patriarch $THEOLOGIAN$ has answered this thorny question by saying:"
 dg_miaphysite.013.a:1 "Let the dead rest (Orthodox)"

 dg_miaphysite.014.t:1 "The Question of Christ's Nature"
 dg_miaphysite.014.d:1 "The most pressing issue dividing Orthodox and Miaphysite Christians was purely theological: what is the nature of Jesus? At the Council of Chalcedon the early church attempted to lay the issue at rest when they declared that Jesus had two natures - divine and mortal - that were united in a single essence. This contradicted the ideas of Nestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople who claimed that Jesus was born human and become divine afterwards.\n\nBoth Orthodox and Miaphysite Christians rejected the Monophysite ideas of Nestorius, but they nevertheless disagreed with each other. Miaphysites claimed that Jesus had one nature - both divine and human - while Orthodox Christians claimed that he had two natures - fully divine and fully human at the same time, unchanging and undivided. While the two sides were not opposites, there was enough difference that it became the cornerstone of the Miaphysite church's opposition to the Orthodox church. When the Romans attempted to heal the schism with the Act of Union, they deliberately criticised the Nestorians while trying to bridge the two views, declaring that Christ had two natures but one will, a view called Monothelite. That opinion was abandoned after Egypt and Syria were lost.\n\nWith the blessing of the $MONARCHTITLE$, Patriarch $THEOLOGIAN$ has answered this thorny question by saying:"
 dg_miaphysite.014.a:1 "He has two natures, unchanging and undivided (Orthodox)"

In $YEAR$, that hope came to fruition! Their Patriarch agreed to accept certain sticking points of theology in exchange for coming into communion with the whole [From.Religion.GetName] Church and keeping their traditional services.

 dg_papacy.001.t:1 "The Papal States"
 dg_papacy.001.d:1 "As the leader of the Catholic Church, the pope held great influence over millions of Catholics. Catholic rulers often envied or despised that influence and attempted to coerce popes into submission. By ruling over an independent state, the pope had an independent source of income and protection that gave him the appearance of neutrality. As a result, Catholic powers had an interest in making sure that Rome - the rightful seat of the Bishop of Rome - remained under the rule of the pope."

Without access to his own source of income, he relies upon the generosity of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to fulfil his duties as Shepherd of the Faithful. These duties require him to spend a not inconsiderable sum of money - all of which we must provide.\n\nAn alternative to this would be to assign him a fief of his own.

As the bishop of Rome, he had a strong claim to the province - but the pope is now a prisoner in his own land, and the papal states no more. Now the nation that conquered Rome has offered a compromise: recognise the pope's rule over a small portion of the city, while securing his agreement that the rest of the province is theirs.

When the capital was moved away from Rome, local despots took advantage of the pope's inattention to establish themselves as rulers of individual cities.

When the capital was moved away from Rome, aristocratic families such as the Orsini, Colonna or Pepoli began to reassert their authority in attempts to seize control of trade or politics.

They argue that the Papacy is weakened by its absence from Italy - both because the rich lands of the peninsula are lost to its direct control, and because the independence of the Vatican itself is in doubt. On the other hand, other cardinals will firmly resist any effort to move the Curia away from $CAPITAL$.

At times the papacy was driven into bankruptcy! Several popes who began their reign with dreams of introducing reforms or rooting out heresy found themselves mired in tax codes and financial records. In an attempt to rebuild state finances, some popes came up with creative ideas.\n\nOne idea was to require priests to charge their parishioners for services that had previously been free. Although lucrative, this caused people to grumble at the greed of the church. Another option was to encourage voluntary donations by granting absolution to pilgrims who gave alms. From there it was a short step to licensing regions to indulgence peddlers who gave the pope a portion of their profits as they over-enthusiastically sold indulgences to peasants. Another idea was to hold a state lottery in which ordinary subjects could buy a chance to win riches. This idea had been tried in other countries with great success, but gambling was seen as a sin by many Christians.

The Donation was used as proof of the pope's claims to Rome and its environs, as well as his claims to authority over secular rulers in the West.\n\nThe Donation failed to hold up to the scrutiny it received during the Renaissance. Not only were some supporting details wrong, but the phraseology and vocabulary of the document were radically wrong for the fourth century.

This created a sense of isolation from the papacy for some countries. The commission is recommending that the papacy internationalize the Curia, establishing a set of rules that will encourage the appointment of cardinals from many nations rather than just those near the Vatican.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform.

New popes had a habit of appointing friends and countrymen to the post, helping to 'stack the deck' in their favour. This caused some friction with the existing cardinals and sometimes led to one nation having more influence over the curia than it ought. The commission is recommending imposing strict limits on the number of cardinals allowed in the curia at one time. This would reduce the ability of the pope to appoint new cardinals and so result in more qualified men taking up the position.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.083.t:1 "Conclave Rules"
 dg_papacy.083.d:1 "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nPapal conclaves were usually swift, but could sometimes drag on for years. Because a two-thirds majority was required for the pope to be chosen, a conclave could go on intermittently if two sides refused to compromise, or if outside pressure was being applied. Sometimes a conclave only ended with the death of one papabile! At other times, a lengthy conclave was explained by the reluctance of the cardinals to cede power. The commission recommends introducing strict new rules to push cardinals to make swift decisions during conclaves. Not only would voting rules be relaxed, but the longer a conclave went on for, the more uncomfortable things would get for the cardinals, as food and water would be gradually reduced and, in extremis, the roof of the building would be removed and the rain let in until a pope was chosen.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform.

 dg_papacy.085.t:1 "Ad Limina Visits"
 dg_papacy.085.d:1 "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges the Church faced was having to maintain orthodoxy across multiple nations and millions of parishioners. To this end, individual bishops were empowered to root out heresy in their dioceses. However, not all bishops were equally effective, and as recent years had shown, it was always better to wipe out heresy as soon as it appeared. The commission recommends imposing 'ad limina' visits on all Catholic bishops - the requirement that they travel to the Vatican every few years in order to report on their dioceses personally. The requirement would be relaxed for bishops who would have a hard time visiting the Vatican, but even then, they would have to make the visit once a decade. Although it was meant to combat absenteeism and heresy, the main effect of this reform would be to increase the authority of the pope.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform.

 dg_papacy.086.d:1 "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nThe official Bible of the Catholic Church was the Latin Vulgate bible. As the West gained access to earlier Greek Bibles, they discovered errors in the translation used in the official text, which led to many Catholics losing faith in their Church. The commission recommends that a team of scholars, theologians and linguists scour these new sources and write a new version of the Vulgate Bible.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform.

The commission recommends establishing a kind of Inquisition to root out heretics from the Papal States, handing them over to secular authorities for punishment. This would become the model used by secular nations to fight against heresy.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."
 dg_papacy.088.t:1 "Rules against nepotism"
 dg_papacy.088.d:1 "After years of work, the commission of cardinals has finally agreed on a series of reforms which they are recommending to Pope $MONARCH$.\n\nLike any other ruler, many popes saw their office as a chance to enrich their families. The problem was that the pope was not just any other ruler - he was the holy leader of the Catholic Church, and such nepotism was giving the Church a bad name. It was even worse when the pope gave special favours to a bastard son born from a mistress. Some priests and even cardinals were known to keep mistresses, but the pope was supposed to be above all that. Having such a visible sign of his sins around, long after his death, was embarrassing for church leaders. The commission recommends imposing a series of laws that would make it difficult for popes to assign benefices, positions and gifts to family members, and require them to send away bastards and mistresses.\n\nLike all papal reforms, it may take more than one commission to enable a reform. The more the church demands reforms, the more effective each option will become."

The pope reached out to powerful Catholic rulers of the 'five kingdoms' of Italy, France, Spain, Germany and England, giving certain rulers the right to veto one candidate each during papal conclaves. They sent cardinals from their lands to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] with instructions to use this right of exclusion if an unacceptable candidate was about to be elected. Although this practise helped prevent anti-popes, it also turned conclaves into political arenas where powerful princes influenced cardinals to elect popes sympathetic to their cause."

 dg_pope.003.t:1 "Deadlocked Conclave"
 dg_pope.003.d:1 "When a conclave was called to elect a new pope, cardinals from across Italy went to the Holy See to join the College of Cardinals. Secluded from the outside world, they remained there until a new pope was chosen by acclamation (unanimous approval) or, if that failed, by receiving two-thirds of the vote. These stringent measures were meant to avoid an anti-pope claiming victory, but they could also result in deadlocked conclaves. Factions supporting different candidates sometimes refused to compromise or back down, vote after vote, sometimes for months on end. To force a choice, Conclaves would be offered only bread and water and, in one memorable instance, actually had the roof of the building removed so the cardinals would be rained on until they came to an agreement."

 dg_pope.004.d:1 "Although nearly every pope was Italian, the fact that Italy was divided meant that many empires had influence there. Papal conclaves could become deeply political with the great powers always interested in the results. At times one nation was able to influence enough votes in the college of cardinals to ensure that a particular candidate was elected. This sometimes resulted in candidates that were elected simply because they would serve the interests of a kingdom or empire, not because they were holy men.\n\nOur influence has allowed us to guide this decision to select the new pope.

 dg_pope.005.d:1 "When the College of Cardinals met, they were instructed to pray for guidance and choose the best man for the church. Despite scandals and corruption, many cardinals were pious men who followed this advice and tried to vote their conscience. The only question was what type of man the church needed! This question divided the college, but by tradition, when a cardinal realised that one papabile was going to win, they would switch their vote to him in order to present a new pope by universal acclaim and avoid a messy election.\n\nWith our help, a new pope has been chosen.

 dg_pope.009.d:1 "According to rules brought in to encourage shorter conclaves, the cardinals were locked in the Vatican and given only the barest of food and water until they came to a decision - sometimes with the corpse of the former pope lying in state next to them. This was not pleasant even under the best of circumstances, but during the blazing Italian summer, it could be deadly to frail old men wearing heavy robes. Cardinals were known to suffer heat stroke during summer conclaves and deaths were not unheard of. When things got particularly rough, the cardinals would occasionally vote to adjourn for the summer and return in the autumn. This was a breach of the rules, but understandable."

 dg_pope.012.d:1 "For both moral and physical reasons, the church forbade marriage to those within seven degrees of separation from each other - as distant as third cousins. This encouraged villagers to travel and marry in other areas and helped avoid many hereditary defects, but it was also quite complex to keep track of genealogy, so the rule resulted in many broken engagements and annulled marriages. The church responded by offering dispensation to couples who were only marginally related to each other. When the petitioners came from the royal families of Christendom, the pope got involved personally. Dispensation was usually granted, but an unscrupulous or ambitious pope could deny it to punish the countries involved for some slight."

This resulted in some rulers turning to the papacy to resolve feuds, succession crises or other problems facing them. The curia would investigate the situation, put each side to the question, and deliberate for weeks or months while studying the precedents and praying for guidance. At the end, the pope would announce his decision on the matter, and in theory, the matter would be settled.

 dg_pope.015.d:1 "From its very beginnings as a religion, differing understandings of doctrine and scripture split the Christian church - sometimes permanently - weakening it against infidels. As a result, the Catholic Church took a hard line against suspected heretics, demanding obedience and repentance in order to not divide the church yet again. When that failed, church councils could sometimes heal a schism. But when Catholic princes took up the cause of heresy as their own, only one solution remained: to convert heretics back to the true faith by the sword. A crusade!"

Popes would call a consistory and announce the names of the new cardinals, who would receive the cap and ring of their new rank in a public ceremony. Although canon law set the number of cardinals to 20, this limit was ignored by popes who saw the need to appoint like-minded bishops, and was later raised to 70. The new cardinals swelling the ranks of the college meant that each cardinal was relatively less important - at least until their number dwindled once more.\n\nAlthough he tried to be neutral, the pope has appointed several cardinals from among the bishops he knew in his home country before his accession to the throne of St. Peter.

 dg_pope.022.d:1 "In the early thirteenth century some canon lawyers speculated what to do if a pope became a heretic, and concluded that ultimate power rested in the hands of the church itself, as embodied in an ecumenical council. Meant as an exercise in theory, it gained serious attention during the schism as rival popes split the church. As they watched successive popes fail to heal the schism, many lay Catholics, bishops and rulers began to believe that only a council could truly reform the church. This culminated in a church council which declared that the pope was required to call a church council every decade - in effect handing over power to the bishops."

Some nations restricted ecclesiastical jurisdiction and clerical immunity; in some nations, an emergency tithe on church property became a regular tax; in many nations, the ruler secured the right to appoint bishops and reform monasteries. Finally, in the 'five kingdoms' of Spain, France, Germany, Italy and England, rulers were offered an extra incentive - a veto over papal candidates in elections.

 dg_pope.031.d:1 "The Catholic church was ordained by God but made up of mortal men, expected to be perfect but sometimes falling short of heaven. Pious Catholics understood this, but occasionally the church could go too far. A particularly odious scandal or blatant corruption could lead to calls for reform in the church.

 dg_pope.032.d:1 "Delegates brought with them criticism and ideas, but although church councils could overrule a sitting pope and set church doctrine, the pope was still the leader of the church. As a result, the pope controlled discussion of the councils by introducing topics to it - although this was by no means a promise that that issue would be resolved, only that it would be discussed. What topic should his holiness emphasise?"

 dg_pope.033.t:1 "Church Reform of Simony"
 dg_pope.033.d:1 "After Clement V reorganised the church, the pope gained the right to appoint bishops to their benefices. When a bishop died, the benefice returned to the pope. An unforeseen effect of this was to encourage simony, or payment in return for church titles. This practise excluded peasants from the highest ranks of the church and placed a burden of debt on bishops that caused many to tax their tenants harshly. As the practise grew widespread it caused a backlash against the church.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."

 dg_pope.034.d:1 "Catholics who sinned needed to go through a process to find forgiveness: first they had to repent the sin, then they had to confess it to a priest, and finally they had to do penance - good works such as pilgrimages or fasting in order to make up for the evil they had done. An indulgence was a way to bypass doing penance by getting the church to bless you with some of the grace of dead saints. Unscrupulous indulgence peddlers went much further, promising that indulgences meant you didn't have to go to confession, that they could allow the dead to escape purgatory, even that they could be used to forgive sins that people had not yet committed! Pious theologians were horrified at these claims but credulous peasants bought them up rapidly. Soon a steady flow of gold passed into the hands of such peddlers, to be split between them, the archbishops who had authorised it, and the pope himself.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise.

 dg_pope.035.d:1 "Beginning in the fourteenth century the pope collected the first year's income (annate) from the benefice granted to a new bishop. This was a common custom by feudal rulers upon granting a fief to a vassal, so by claiming this right, the pope was taking money away from secular rulers. In addition, regardless of who the money went to, this practise forced new bishops to borrow heavily or overtax their peasants in order to pay this sum, something which made the church seem oppressive to the locals.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."

 dg_pope.036.d:1 "Although large cities often had cathedral schools where future priests received a classical education alongside noble scions, more rural parishes often had little access to schooling and little money to send a priest away for several years. Instead, local nobles appointed priests, and these priests trained their successors personally. This was simple, but led to uneducated priests who sometimes couldn't even read Latin! It was no wonder that these rural parishes could become centres of heresy. In theory the fault lay in local bishops whose task was to oversee the priests in their diocese, but in practise they were often suffering from the same problems.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."

 dg_pope.037.d:1 "After Clement V reorganised the church, the pope gained the right to appoint bishops to their benefices in return for payment. As this practise became more widespread, some nobles saw it as an investment. They spent vast sums of money to secure two or more benefices for themselves or a son. By holding two offices at the same time, such bishops gained a large income, but this practise of pluralism also meant vacant diocese with no trained bishop living there, which only added to the problems the church was suffering. Some bishops went so far as to openly live far away from any of their benefices, preferring big city life instead.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise. The higher church reform desire is, the more effective reforms will be. However, it requires papal influence to push the harshest reforms forward."

 dg_pope.038.d:1 "It was an accepted practise for kings and princes to give fiefs to their sons. As the prestige of the papacy grew, popes grew in status to be equals of these princes, owning vast estates and commanding armies. Many acted as a prince would, granting fiefs to their relatives or illegitimate children or making nephews cardinals with valuable benefices. This entirely secular behaviour did not enhance the prestige of the papacy.\n\nIt may require several reforms to eradicate this entrenched practise.

 dg_pope.041.d:1 "Everyone agreed that the schism that had split the Catholic church needed to be dealt with, but increasingly it appeared that the rival popes were unwilling or unable to do it themselves. As a result, frustrated Catholics looked to ecumenical councils to provide the solution. At a Church council, enough cardinals could be brought together to depose the anti-popes and elect a new one that everyone would agree on. But there was a catch to this solution: it meant that not only would this new pope, but all future popes would be subservient to councils. Reformers went even further, demanding that the pope agree to call councils on a regular basis in order to prevent this kind of schism from ever happening again."

 dg_pope.041.b:1 "Maintain the supremacy of the pope"
 dg_pope.042.t:1 "The Lollard Question"
 dg_pope.042.d:1 "Over the past two generations a heresy has arisen in Christendom. The so-called 'Lollards' began as a movement to reform the church, believing that the corruption in the church could be eradicated by having the church give up its secular power and wealth. That in itself was bad enough, but the Lollards went even further by demanding that all worshippers have the right to partake in both body and blood of Christ during communion. This went against Catholic doctrine, which taught that Christ was entirely present in each, and so there was no need to have both. This 'Calixtine' doctrine, then, was a clear heresy - and needed to be purged from the church, as it had done so many times before, lest it damage the unity of the church.\n\nAt the council, church leaders heard from Lollard theologians, refuting their claims and showing them the truth - yet they failed to repent or recant. Reluctantly, the council ordered the execution of the heretics."

 dg_pope.051.t:1 "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.051.d:1 "In a time when it could take letters months to reach parts of Europe, clarity was essential to avoid misunderstandings on crucial issues. For this reason the church used Latin as its only language, and this prompted scholars across Europe to use it as well as a common tongue of learning. As centuries passed, however, this adherence to a dead language made the Bible and the Mass inaccessible to the common man. Protestants, who emphasised a personal relationship with God and who had no central authority to demand a common theology, allowed the use of the vernacular instead. It was clear from the spread of the Reformation just how powerful a method this was, and many voices in the church demanded it change in order to keep up with them. Others demanded the church ban it entirely in order to keep itself pure.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine. However, the higher church reform is, the more quickly the church will realise it has to take a stand."

 dg_pope.051.b:1 "Allow the local tongue to be used"
 dg_pope.052.t:1 "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.052.d:1 "Many of the theological debates of the Reformation went over the heads of the common worshipper. One that did not was the communion. Catholic tradition argued that the body and blood of Christ was found in both the bread and wine of sacrament, which meant ordinary Catholics had no need to partake of both. As a result, the cup of His blood was reserved for priests. This seemed unfair to the average peasant, and had been one of the key issues of the Hussite wars of the fifteenth century.\n\nProtestants took up this belief, claiming that since every believer had a personal relationship with God, they were all priests and could therefore drink from the cup. Some Catholic reformers felt like allowing all worshippers to drink from the cup would convince Protestants to return to the church, while others saw it as a dangerous precedent to bend doctrine.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine. However, the higher church reform is, the more quickly the church will realise it has to take a stand."

 dg_pope.053.t:1 "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.053.d:1 "The printing press, growing literacy and the translation of the Bible into the vernacular led to many people reading the Bible for the first time. Many were shocked to find no clear evidence for some Catholic traditions such as clerical celibacy, confession, transubstantiation or papal infallibility. Protestants used this to claim that the church had strayed from what Christ wanted and vowed to make doctrine based purely on the Bible, while Catholics accused Protestants of being inflexible and outdated, arguing that centuries of tradition were worth as much as scripture. However, some Catholics wanted to take the opportunity to return the church to its fundamentals.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine. However, the higher church reform is, the more quickly the church will realise it has to take a stand."

 dg_pope.054.t:1 "The Fate of the Catholic Church"
 dg_pope.054.d:1 "One of the sharpest differences between Catholics and Protestants was the latter's emphasis on salvation by faith alone. To the Protestants, belief in Jesus Christ was all that was needed to go to Heaven, while the Catholic church emphasised showing your faith through good works. This debate highlighted one of the scandals of the church: 'good works' included almsgiving, and at times the Catholic church had used this to justify charging worshippers money for church services or to free souls from Purgatory. While both Protestants and Catholics agreed this practise had to end, they were divided over how far to take it. Most Catholics continued to see good works as a necessary part of being Christian, while Protestants went to the other extreme.\n\nDoctrinal decisions such as this were hotly debated in the church. Before a decision could be adopted, it had to be accepted by church leaders. This often demanded multiple councils agreeing on a doctrine.

 dg_pope.055.d:1 "The Protestant Reformation was never intended to be a break from the Catholic church, but rather a wake-up call to its leadership that change was desperately needed. The church reacted by excommunicating reformers and their followers, giving them little choice but to break off from [the_vatican.GetCapitalName]. In church councils the papacy deliberately defined Catholicism in opposition to Protestant doctrine, pushing the church even further away from compromise. Instead, the new focus of the church was to seek out and defeat heresy as it had many times before. The doctrinal debates of the Counter-Reformation helped to inspire ordinary Catholics to do just that."

 dg_pope.056.d:1 "The Protestant Reformation was never intended to be a break from the Catholic church, but rather a wake-up call to its leadership that change was desperately needed. The hope of compromise was met by strong popes who purged the church of corruption and then redefined it by compromising with reformers. Response to this Catholic Reformation varied; moderates returned to the church, but radicals expressed their mistrust by growing even more virulently anti-Catholic. There was little room for a middle ground any longer. The waves of returning Catholics left the church with a problem, though: many Protestant nobles had seized church lands, enriching themselves immeasurably. Others had taken advantage of the Reformation to grant themselves powers which they were reluctant to give up. Would it be wise to force them to give up these gains?"

 dg_pope.057.d:1 "Pious Catholics watched in horror as the church was sundered by the Reformation. While the church struggled to survive, a few men took it upon themselves to take the fight to the enemy. A former soldier who felt called to a higher purpose took his martial training and turned it to a new life of monasticism. Together with several comrades, they called themselves the Company of Jesus - monks who would be so devoted to the church that they would believe white was black if told so by the pope. This new order was scorned at first, called 'Jesuits' for their obsession with Jesus - but they got results. Establishing colleges to train new missionaries, the order became a powerful force for fighting heresy."

To help persuade locals to convert, they allowed them to continue to venerate their ancestors, celebrate festivals and practise Confucian rituals.\n\nWhen rival orders of Dominican and Franciscan monks arrived, they were horrified at what they saw.

 dg_humanism.001.d:1 "In fourteenth century Italy, a man named Petrarch founded Humanism when he claimed God had gifted man with intellect - and so any intellectual pursuit could be divine. This allowed artists and philosophers to appreciate classical Greek and Roman writers for their brilliance rather than condemning them for their paganism. The concurrent decline of Byzantium led to many Greek scholars fleeing west, where the church-sponsored translations of Greek texts into Latin. This made them accessible for the first time to the new, literate middle class that had arisen after the Black Death. This rediscovery of classical thinking led to an enthusiastic recovery of ancient Roman ideas and techniques that spread across Europe in a splendid flowering of culture."

Happening at a time when Greek scholars fleeing the decline of Byzantium brought back ancient texts that the West had forgotten, this led to the rediscovery and appreciation of ancient Roman writers and artists for their brilliance, rather than their condemnation as pagans. The new, literate middle class that had arisen after the Black Death was just the audience to enthusiastically rediscover the glories of Rome, and this rebirth of classical culture spread across Europe in a splendid flowering of culture.

The document was used as proof of the pope's claims to Rome and his authority over European rulers.\n\nThe Donation failed to hold up to the scrutiny it received during the Renaissance. Not only were some supporting details wrong, but new humanist techniques found that the phraseology and vocabulary of the document were radically wrong for the fourth century.

The Catholic Church already had a Latin translation, of course - but by going back to preserved Greek copies, it was possible to compare early Christian verses with modern ones.\n\nPage by page, the new translation compared the official Vulgate translation with the new one, showing errors and omissions.

Even cures practised by barbers, magicians or chemists were fair game if they worked, and even cures practised by the Church were wrong if they did not. For that reason, $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$ spoke out publicly against the use of sacred relics in treating the sick - a topic that inevitably resulted in angry mobs and a sudden move to a new town.\n\nOver the years, $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$ developed a series of experimental treatments using a new third principle of alchemy: the use of mineral salts to complement the existing use of sulphur and mercury.

Scientists were backed up by the Catholic Church, which pointed to lines in scripture that implied the Sun rotated around an unmoving Earth.\n\nTo publish the theory would mean contradicting both consensus and Bible - and $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$ was a devout Catholic.

With the horoscope circulating even beyond the borders of $COUNTRY$, church leaders have called on the $MONARCHTITLE$ to charge the author with heresy.\n\nThis is not the first time $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$ has caused a scandal.

 dg_humanism.020.d:1 "By the middle of the fifteenth century, several print masters were on the verge of a revolution. A former goldsmith, $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$ devised an alloy of lead, tin and antimony that would melt at low temperatures but be durable in a printing press. This allowed individual pieces to be reused by arranging them in any order. One set of letters allowed printers an infinite number of texts! $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$ attempted to keep the process a secret, but copies of the original quickly spread to every major city in Europe.\n\nPreviously, European printers had used wooden blocks, hand-carved with text and pictures, in order to print onto blank paper. This allowed mass printing but was costly and time-consuming. More common was to hire a monk in a scriptorium to hand-copy a text for you - a process that could take months, and inevitably resulted in errors creeping in. The new system of movable type meant that more books could be printed for a fraction of the price with few errors - and suddenly, books went from being family heirlooms to being consumed in ever increasing numbers by the middle class, and monks went from being respected scribes to being unemployed - and increasingly outraged at the humanist books coming off the press."

The portrait is not only beautiful, it also uses a number of techniques unheard of by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ artists. The use of landscapes in the background, the illusion of three-dimensional features through layers of semi-transparent glazes, and the illusion of light and shadow created by painting without outlines. This 'sfumato' technique is groundbreaking, and this painting is a masterpiece of the technique! Surely its enigmatic smile deserves to hang in the $MONARCHTITLE$'s palace."

This gives us a conundrum: where to place this work of art. Many of the artists involved in its creation favour placing it in the town square, to be admired by all. The priests would prefer it to be housed in the cathedral, to inspire the faithful. Finally, our nobles want it to be placed at the entrance to the palace, to show all the power and wealth of the $MONARCHTITLE$."

 dg_humanism.023.d:1 "$ARTIST$ is an accomplished artist whose paintings are widely recognised as the best in $COUNTRY$ - but now those paintings are being thrown into the fire.\n\nLike most Renaissance painters of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ school, $ARTIST$ began by painting Biblical themes. As humanism spread, these themes began to be replaced by Neoplatonic ones in which Christianity was shown through the symbolism in pagan mythology. For example, the Virgin Mary and the sacrament of baptism could both be shown in a painting of the birth of the Roman goddess Venus. In this way, mythological scenes could be openly painted without arousing the ire of the Church.\n\nA particularly fiery preacher has exposed this for the fiction it is, and has demanded that heretical and indecent images be publicly destroyed in a great bonfire - and $ARTIST$ has decided to turn over a new leaf and follow him."

Traditional $COUNTRY_ADJ$ painting used transparent glazes to conceal the brushwork, while this new 'impasto' style was rough and uneven. More shocking was the content. Most Renaissance painters chose moral and religious themes, and $ARTIST$ was no exception. This painting, however, was dark and fantastical, the stuff of dreams and nightmares - more gruesome than pleasant to look at. Because of this, the court at $CAPITAL_CITY$ is unsure what to make of it. Is this the birth of a new style? Or just a deliberate attempt to shock and disgust?"

The work of a master, the fresco is an example of classical art in every way: beautiful religious figures, realistic down to the last detail. At its unveiling, the audience of aristocrats and church leaders were stunned to see genitals on the saints and angels. $ARTIST$ refuses to amend it - the latest in a series of such scandals.\n\nAlready many young painters, convinced that Classicism has reached its conclusion, have begun to experiment with new styles of painting and sculpture - adding unusual emotions, scale, lighting, colours and perspectives. In contrast with Classical art, this school of Mannerism also shies away from mythological scenes and human nudity. Perhaps it is time for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ art to seek a new direction?"

 dg_humanism.026.d:1 "The Renaissance was a period when the Greek and Roman classics were rediscovered and translated into Latin. In the middle ages, they had been shunned for being pagan, but now Humanist scholars evaluated them on their ideas rather than on their heresy. Ancient writers such as Plato, Socrates and Aristotle had much to say on topics such as ethics and politics, and those ideas were just as relevant in $YEAR$ as they had been two thousand years earlier.\n\nThe result was a flowering of philosophy, poetry and science as the ancient classics inspired modern interpretations. However, it was also a time of increased scepticism about religion. If a pagan who died long before Christ was born could use logic to determine good and evil, what did that say about the Bible? To many $COUNTRY_ADJ$ philosophers, the answer was simple: being a good Christian meant following a code of ethics, not following the Bible. One could live an ethical life by being honest, hard-working, generous and kind without ever touching a relic, going on a pilgrimage or purchasing an indulgence. But then where did this leave the Church?"

Once thought destroyed, many classics were rediscovered in Greek texts - but very few scholars could read Greek. To encourage study, $PHILOSOPHER$ wrote a Greek dictionary and opened a college that would teach students three languages: the sacred languages of Latin, Greek and Hebrew, the better to study the Bible and the classics in their original forms.\n\nThis has caused a backlash as Church theologians worry that untrained Christians reading the Bible will misunderstand its nuances and study in foreign tongues will reintroduce long-dead heresies. The controversy has only spurred $PHILOSOPHER$ onward, however: Now we have a request for the $MONARCHTITLE$ to provide royal funding for a library of humanist texts to support the college."

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must be willing to exercise brute force and deceit to head off challenges to $RULER_ADJ$ authority and establish legitimacy and stability - in other words, the ends justify the means.\n\nWhile well-written, it may be dangerous to follow its advice.

Each new year seemed to herald yet another classic being translated into Latin, another heady topic for intellectuals to debate. In the midst of all this, $PHILOSOPHER$ made a startling proposal to the $MONARCHTITLE$: re-found a Platonic Academy in $CAPITAL_CITY$!\n\nThe original Academy in Athens was not a school in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sense. Instead, it was a place in which like-minded students of philosophy could meet and discuss literature and politics without fear of reprisals, pose philosophical problems for each other to solve, and give lectures to anyone who might be present.

Many of them survived only in Greek, and so humanist scholars such as $PHILOSOPHER$ made a living by translating them into Latin.\n\nOf particular interest was the Code of Justinian, a code of laws established in the later Roman Empire. Customary medieval law focused heavily on precedent and oral tradition and was resistant to change, whereas Roman law set out clear rules and gave power to the state. It was tempting for the $MONARCHTITLE$ to introduce Roman law to $COUNTRY$ by establishing royal courts that could bypass common law and give the $MONARCHTITLE$ the power to raise taxes.\n\nAlthough this was a popular idea with humanists, it was seen as a naked power grab by the nobility and peasants who stood to lose power."

There are a number of possible men who could be appointed to the purple; if we call in some favours, we could convince his holiness of the virtues of our candidate and ensure his appointment in the future.\n\nThis decision will increase the chance of us getting a cardinal whenever cardinals are appointed by the pope."
 commission_of_cardinals_title:1 "§G†§! Establish a Commission of Cardinals"
 commission_of_cardinals_desc:1 "When a pope wanted to institute reforms, he had two options. One was to call a general church council with bishops from across Europe; this was useful when theology was being debated. The other was to establish a council of cardinals who would work together with the pope; this was useful when rules were being debates, especially when they applied to the Vatican itself rather than the entire church. This kind of commission could spend years before deciding on a reform, but when it did it had considerable support."
 complete_miaphysite_act_of_union_title:1 "§G†§! Revise the Act of Union"
 complete_miaphysite_act_of_union_desc:1 "Our attempt to unite the Orthodox and Miaphysite churches is flawed and controversial. The churches have not fully integrated and still treat each other with suspicion. With great effort, we might be able to forge a new agreement that would unite the churches in truth as well as in name.\n\nWe will need a brilliant theologian, a determined ruler, the goodwill of both churches, a cooperative ecumenical patriarch, and the blessing of all five patriarchs to have even a chance of success."
 concordat_of_bologna_title:1 "§G†§! Sign a concordat with the pope"
 concordat_of_bologna_desc:1 "The pragmatic sanction was a direct threat to the authority of the pope, who refused to acknowledge it. With a bit of diplomacy, however, a lasting compromise could be reached. Under the terms of a concordat, the powers gained in the Pragmatic Sanction were confirmed by the pope in return for a veto over unsuitable candidates, the right to collect church income, and the confirmation that the pope, not church councils, was the rightful head of the church. It was a compromise that, while pleasing no one, could last for centuries."
 consolidate_latin_patriarchate_title:1 "§G†§! Ask the pope to move the seat of the Patriarch"
 consolidate_latin_patriarchate_desc:1 "Our capital city lays under the ecclesiastical authority of the Latin Patriarch, even though he rules from afar. This humiliation could be reversed were the pope willing to redraw the borders of the patriarchate and move its seat to our capital. Such a move would further enhance its status as a world-class city."
 convert_to_chaldean_title:1 "§G†§! Follow the Patriarch of Assyria"
 convert_to_chaldean_desc:1 "Having the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East under our control gives Christians in our lands someone to turn to other than our official leaders overseas. With our ruler as the head of the church, it has become possible for us to convert to this Chaldean Christianity by recognising the Patriarch of Assyria as the true head of the church."
 convert_to_miaphysite_title:1 "§G†§! Follow the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch"
 convert_to_miaphysite_desc:1 "Having the Patriarch of Alexandria or Antioch under our control gives Christians in our lands someone to turn to other than our official leaders overseas. With our ruler as the head of the church, it has become possible for us to convert to this Miaphysite Christianity by recognising a Patriarch as the true head of the church."

 make_donation_of_constantine_title:1 "§G†§! Donate a province to host the papacy"
 make_donation_of_constantine_desc:1 "Although we have a strong connection with the pope, he is too far away to properly influence or protect. By assigning a fief to him, we could ensure that he would be safe from enemies - and that our cardinals would be in place during papal conclaves."

 evangelical_union_title:1 "§G†§! Establish the $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ Union of Churches"
 evangelical_union_desc:1 "Reformed and Protestant Christians lived side by side, but not always peacefully. Despite having much in common, the two churches were divided theologically and by their leadership. Many Protestant rulers saw this division as wasteful and sought to bridge the gap between them, but all compromise failed. One solution remained: legally uniting them. Unlike Catholics, both Protestants and Reformed Christians recognised the authority of the state over them, so the state could enforce a single book of liturgy and prayer common to all Protestants and appoint bishops to rule them. This would, in theory, bring all Protestants into a single union. In reality, not all would join the new church, but enough would to make it worthwhile. (This will increase toleration of minorities of the other faith by +2)"
 heal_the_schism_pentarchy_title:1 "§G†§! Attempt to heal the Western Schism"
 heal_the_schism_pentarchy_desc:1 "By restoring the Pentarchy and appointing a proper Patriarch of Rome, we can be said to have ended the Great Schism - the dream of generations of faithful Christians. Let us send missionaries to all the Schismatics inviting them to end their heresy, receive baptism and pledge loyalty to the Patriarch!"
 henotikon_title:1 "§G†§! Attempt to heal the Eastern Schism"
 henotikon_desc:1 "The Miaphysite and Orthodox churches have been split since the fifth century, but the two faiths share much in common. The Romans tried twice to heal the schism only to face dissension from both churches each time, then lost control of the patriarchates. Can we really do better than Justinian?\n\nWe will need a brilliant theologian, a determined ruler, the goodwill of both churches, a cooperative ecumenical patriarch, and the blessing of all five patriarchs to have even a chance of success."
 holy_synod_title:1 "§G†§! Establish a Holy Synod"
 holy_synod_desc:1 "Depending on his personality, a Patriarch can be a ruler's best friend or his most hated enemy. By establishing a permanent synod to rule the church, we can avoid having this issue. We will replace the Patriarch with a twelve member college presided over by a chief procurator appointed by the ruler. This will ensure that the church leadership will remain loyal, if uninspired."
 hundred_chapter_synod_title:1 "§G†§! Call the Hundred Chapter Synod"
 hundred_chapter_synod_desc:1 "We can summon all the bishops of our nation together to create a standardised church liturgy, proclaim the inviolability of church property and give church courts jurisdiction over their members. This will greatly strengthen the church in our country, giving them the power to convert heretics and heathens."
 independent_vatican_title:1 "§G†§! Root out foreign influence from the curia"
 independent_vatican_desc:1 "From time to time, popes were elected who saw the dangers of kings and emperors influencing papal elections. These popes worked to reduce the amount of influence that foreign rulers had over the curia, although this created resentment and their efforts were not always successful."
 miaphysite_ark_coronation_title:1 "§G†§! Be crowned by the Church"
 miaphysite_ark_coronation_desc:1 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Empire protected the Ark of the Covenant, brought from Israel to Axum in the fourth century and kept safe and secret at the Church of Our Lady of Zion in [ark_of_the_covenant.GetName]. Each monarch would make the journey to the isolated monastery to be crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by the monks who tended to the Ark. Ironically, not even [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was permitted to view the Ark itself - only to be blessed by its watchers."
 miaphysite_commission_glory_of_kings_title:1 "§G†§! Commission a national religious epic"
 miaphysite_commission_glory_of_kings_desc:1 "Surrounded by powerful heathens and bereft of allies, our people are afraid. What they need is to draw strength from their isolation and their traditions, and our religious leaders may just have the solution in some Coptic texts they have found."
 miaphysite_disestablish_royal_church_title:1 "§G†§! Stop funding Royal Churches"
 miaphysite_disestablish_royal_church_desc:1 "Opulent Royal Churches funded by the state served to provide balance to the influence of monasteries and enhance the prestige of the royal family. Now that there is no need for this service, it is a waste of money that could better be spent elsewhere."
 miaphysite_expedition_title:1 "§G†§! Send an expedition to the King of the Spains"
 miaphysite_expedition_desc:1 "Rumour has it that in faraway Spain, the Christians there have taken the fight to the Muslims and driven them back! Perhaps such a powerful Christian ruler could become an ally in our fight for survival. We could send an expedition to make contact with these faraway Christians and hope they listen to our pleas."
 miaphysite_incorporate_monasteries_title:1 "§G†§! Incorporate the monasteries into the Church"
 miaphysite_incorporate_monasteries_desc:1 "With the Church too weak to convert heathens to Christianity, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stepped in and made reforms. Monasteries were given more influence over the Church and fiefs of land ('gult') which allowed them to avoid hiring themselves out to local farmers to provide food for themselves. In return, the monasteries provided the Church with a needed supply of priests and maintained a library of religious books so that it could provide instruction to new priests. At the same time, the now wealthier monks were increasingly beholden to the state and less likely to criticise it."
 miaphysite_plant_royal_church_title:1 "§G†§! Plant a Royal Church"
 miaphysite_plant_royal_church_desc:1 "Most churches are run by monks who owe loyalty first to the Church and only second to the state. For this reason the state sometimes established opulent shrines that were staffed predominantly by canons rather than by monks in a process known as 'planting' (takkala). Royal churches rivalled the monasteries and their influence at court and helped spread the message that the kingship was sacred. Many rulers would be buried in these royal churches."
 miaphysite_relax_christian_rules_title:1 "§G†§! Relax rules for Christians"
 miaphysite_relax_christian_rules_desc:1 "The strict rules for Christians helped Christians to stand out and discouraged conversion to other faiths - but at the same time, it discouraged conversion to Christianity or even tolerance of other faiths. It may be in the best interests of the state to relax the rules."
 miaphysite_strict_christian_rules_title:1 "§G†§! Impose strict rules for Christians"
 miaphysite_strict_christian_rules_desc:1 "In order to encourage Christianity in [Root.GetName], the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] imposed harsh rules for Christians. Each was required to attend church on all Sabbath days, receiving communion only at the recommendation of their confessor. Every Christian was required to openly wear signs of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost on their foreheads and arms. Holy days and fasts were enforced by royal troops. Consulting with witch doctors, offering sacrifices to pagan gods and practising magic were all punishable by death. In this way the faith of the people stayed strong, even in adversity."
 offer_concordat_with_rome_title:1 "§G†§! Settle the question of Rome"
 offer_concordat_with_rome_desc:1 "The pope no longer rules in Rome, and efforts to restore him have failed. Perhaps it is time to offer a compromise and settle the issue once and for all?"
 patronato_real_title:1 "§G†§! Purchase control of the church overseas"
 patronato_real_desc:1 "The discovery of new lands overseas spurred dreams of converting untold millions to Christianity. The pope is willing to give us control of church lands in the colonies in return for church control over education in the colonies, the free passage of missionaries to convert the natives, and a portion of the income of church lands there."
 permanent_inquisition_title:1 "§G†§! Establish a state inquisition"
 permanent_inquisition_desc:1 "We could establish a permanent inquisition in our nation. Unlike medieval inquisitions, early modern inquisitions were an arm of the law and not beholden to the pope. Their goal was to root out heresy among Catholics, although sometimes they were used against heretics and heathens. In addition to fighting heresy, inquisitions investigated accusations of witchcraft, simony, blasphemy and other ecclesiastical crimes. Since a convicted heretic's property was given to his accuser, they were also used to settle scores and keep rivals in line, both by commoners and by the ruler. However, once begun, an inquisition could be hard to suppress."
 pragmatic_sanction_title:1 "§G†§! Declare independence from the Vatican"
 pragmatic_sanction_desc:1 "Unique among religions, the Catholic church maintained the special position of the pope as head of the church, regardless of nation or laws. As a result, the papacy meddled in local politics, from choosing bishops for benefices to demanding the first year's income (annate) from church estates to trying clergy under ecclesiastical law. By issuing a pragmatic sanction, we declare our belief in the supremacy of church councils, not the pope. This effectively makes our Catholic church independent by allowing clerics to be elected rather than appointed, banning the payment of annates, and limiting appeals to [the_vatican.GetCapitalName]. This puts the full power of the church into the hands of our ruler."
 promulgate_papal_constitution_title:1 "§G†§! Promulgate a constitution"
 promulgate_papal_constitution_desc:1 "The Papal States was a patchwork of cities that owed fealty to the pope. Each was run in a different manner, with differing traditions and powerful families dominating their politics. This could lead to the rise of despots and to breakaway cities. One solution to the problem was to write a constitution for the Papal States that would replace local laws with a single, unified code of laws. This was an effective weapon against nationalism and decentralisation - but it was also a threat to the power of the despots, some of whom had to be forced to comply."

 replace_patriarch_title:1 "§G†§! Replace the patriarch"
 replace_patriarch_desc:1 "As the Pontifex Maximus, our ruler is not only the head of state, but also head of the church. If a patriarch displeases him, he can be replaced. This will not endear the church to us, however."
 repudiate_miaphysite_agreement_title:1 "§G†§! Repudiate the Act of Union"
 repudiate_miaphysite_agreement_desc:1 "It is clear that the Act of Union is not enough to satisfy either the Miaphysites or the Orthodox church. As it stands, the act is bringing us trouble, not unity. Let us be rid of it and at least our own church will be happy!"
 request_annulment_title:1 "§G†§! Request annulment"
 request_annulment_desc:1 "Despite trying for some time, our ruler has failed to produce an heir. It might be time to seek an annulment!\n\nSince the Catholic Church does not permit divorce, someone wishing to dissolve their marriage has to seek an annulment instead - prove that the marriage had been invalid in the first place due to fraud, error, or the inability to produce children. Although it could be difficult to prove these, it could be done - especially when the resources of the government were applied to the case. When a monarch needed an annulment, it was up to the pope to decide.\n\nNote: If we have a royal marriage with another country, this may harm our relations with them."
 request_archbishopric_title:1 "§G†§! Request an archbishopric"
 request_archbishopric_desc:1 "The Church has not seen fit to grace us with an archbishop of our own. Surely his Holiness can be persuaded to appoint one for a nation as great as ours?"
 request_autocephaly_title:1 "§G†§! Request Autocephaly for our church"
 request_autocephaly_desc:1 "Our religious head is a Metropolitan, confirmed by the Patriarch rather than our ruler. A powerful ruler could take advantage of weaker Patriarchs by bribing them into agreeing to raise our Metropolitan to a Patriarchate.\n\nOur ecumenical patriarch has the most influence on this decision; the other Patriarchs are likely to follow his lead. A Patriarch who is considerably weaker than us, or even a prisoner of heretics or heathens, would be much likelier to agree to surrender some of his authority to us."
 request_autonomy_title:1 "§G†§! Request Autonomy for our church"
 request_autonomy_desc:1 "Our state church is an arm of the patriarchate, and as a result our people suffer through services in other languages. If we asked our Exarch to appeal to the Patriarch, he might grant us the boon of autonomy, giving us the right to preach the gospel in our native language."
 request_council_title:1 "§G†§! Request an Ecumenical Council"
 request_council_desc:1 "Beginning with the Council of Nicea, the Catholic church had made important decisions via consensus during church-wide councils. Many in our nation believe that now, another council is needed. We could use our influence with the Holy See to try and make his holiness see our point of view."
 request_dispensation_bribe_title:1 "§G†§! Send gifts to the pope to aid our case"
 request_dispensation_bribe_desc:1 "When a ruler faced censure from the church, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ could request dispensation from a higher authority: the pope. Yet popes were mortal men, and involved in the affairs of princes. A wise or desperate ruler might pave the way for reconciliation with gold."
 request_dispensation_title:1 "§G†§! Request dispensation from the pope"
 request_dispensation_desc:1 "When a ruler faced censure from the church, $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ could request dispensation from a higher authority: the pope. We can instruct our archbishop to make a case in the Holy See for us to be welcomed back into the Catholic church."

 restore_catholicos_of_armenia_desc:1 "Etchmiadzin Cathedral is the seat of the Catholicos of the Mother Church of Armenia, the leader of all Armenian Miaphysite Christians. Sadly neglected over the centuries, it could be restored and the Catholicos once again seated upon his throne."
 secular_courts_catholic_title:1 "§G†§! Close canonical courts"
 secular_courts_catholic_desc:1 "During the middle ages the church policed itself, with its own independent laws and courts. Ecclesiastical courts tended to be more lenient than secular ones; crimes that normally resulted in execution of the guilty, such as sodomy or bestiality, usually resulted in sentences of pilgrimages or public confession in ecclesiastical courts. As a result, anyone who could somehow claim clerical status, such as university students, asked to be tried under an ecclesiastical court - sometimes by appealing directly to the pope in [the_vatican.GetCapitalName]. While perfectly legal, this was not always popular with the public, and as the power of the papacy waned, some countries began stripping clerics of this privilege.\n\nThis decision will shield us from the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction event."
 secularize_order_title:1 "§G†§! Secularise the Order"
 secularize_order_desc:1 "The Protestant Reformation criticised the role of priests and monks. Even faithful Catholics began to have doubts about them, and record numbers of priests and monks walked away from their vows to embrace secular life. Facing a crisis of faith, grandmasters had to chart a path for their nation to survive, and the obvious solution was to become a monarchy rather than a theocracy."
 cannot_border_heathens:1 "You do not border heathen countries"
 seek_elders_blessing_title:1 "§G†§! Seek the blessing of a holy hermit"
 seek_elders_blessing_desc:1 "Monks who eschewed civilisation and lived by themselves in the wilderness were considered the height of holiness in the Orthodox church. As hermits, they were not part of the standard church hierarchy, yet lived saintly lives devoted to God. Pilgrims seeking advice or blessings from a holy man sought out such hermits, even in the depths of the wilderness. Even rulers were known to do so at times, even though it took them away from the capital for some time."
 suppress_inquisition_title:1 "§G†§! Suppress the inquisition"
 suppress_inquisition_desc:1 "The inquisition was effective but unpopular. Without heresy to fight, the inquisition turned on recent converts and Catholics accused of blasphemy by their neighbours. This could be a useful scapegoat, but it won the inquisition no friends. Some rulers fought the inquisition's influence, but doing so could be difficult once it had gained roots in the country."
 uniate_church_title:1 "§G†§! Create a Uniate Church"
 uniate_church_desc:1 "Orthodox Christianity and Catholicism had no love lost between them, despite centuries of working together. Perhaps we can change that by instituting a Uniate church in our lands. With the support of the pope, we will allow Orthodox Christians to retain their liturgical practises, allow Orthodox clergy to marry, and exempt Orthodox priests from forced labour. In return, Orthodox Christians must accept papal authority, unleavened Eucharist bread, the existence of authority and the truth of the Filioque. This compromise will allow the two faiths to live in peace."
 union_of_florence_title:1 "§G†§! Unite the two churches"
 union_of_florence_desc:1 "The schism between east and west was regretted by both sides, and from time to time the pope or patriarch would try to resolve it through negotiation with their counterpart during church councils. The ecumenical council going on right now gives us the opportunity to unite the churches once more...but on their terms, not ours. Our desperation and weakness gives us little choice but to accept the supremacy of [the_vatican.GetCapitalName] and adopt most of their ways if we want their aid against the infidel! The pope has promised to call a crusade to aid us should we do so, although that promise means little unless we ourselves go to war."
 union_of_florence_promise_title:1 "§G†§! Acknowledge the primacy of the Pope"
 union_of_florence_promise_desc:1 "We promised to convert at the Church Council. The Pope has agreed to give us time to make the changes needed to introduce the Catholic religion in our lands, but if we wish to push for change now, we can do so."
 witchcraft_laws_title:1 "§G†§! Pass the Witchcraft Act"
 witchcraft_laws_desc:1 "In an era with centralised justice system, witch hunts and mob lynchings were an embarrassment at best, a danger at worst. Although the hunts themselves were declared illegal, this did not stop mobs from forming during legal witch trials. The solution, then, was to declare the trials themselves illegal - and to arrest anyone who accused someone else of being a witch. With that, the problem abruptly went away."
 withdraw_inquisition_support_title:1 "§G†§! Withdraw support for the inquisition"
 withdraw_inquisition_support_desc:1 "The inquisition served a useful purpose, but it has its limits. Rulers had to balance the benefits of the inquisition against its unpopularity among the population. Withdrawing state support not only distanced the ruler from the inquisition, it also weakened it as well."
 
 absentee_bishop:1 "Absentee Bishop"
 desc_absentee_bishop:1 "Bishoprics were not only important centres of the church, they were also large landholdings that could create wealth for their holder. Some bishops took this money but ignored their duties, choosing to live elsewhere. This could have a negative effect on their dioceses."

 desc_appointed_bishops_aspect:1 "Our Church has a hierarchical organisation in which local ministers are appointed by bishops, who in turn are appointed by the head of the Church.

 desc_augustinian_order:1 "This province is home to an important chapter of the Augustinian order.\n\nAugustinian monks devoted themselves to charity and performed many good works.

 catholic_alienation:1 "Catholic alienation"
 desc_Catholic_alienation:1 "The compromise worked out with Protestants to save the church was a one-sided deal that angered many traditional Catholics. By ignoring their concerns the church made many enemies. Lacking any real alternative these disaffected Catholics remained in the church but showed their dissent in a variety of ways."
 desc_catholic_alienation:1 "The Protestant Reformation began as a movement to reform the church by liberal elements. By agreeing to Protestant demands, the church has mollified many liberals - but at the cost of antagonizing its conservative elements. Although they are unlikely to leave the church, their dissatisfaction with the direction the church is taking is felt in a wide variety of ways."
 catholic_archbishopric:1 "Archbishopric"
 desc_catholic_archbishopric:1 "This province is the seat of a Catholic archbishopric, giving its owner more influence over the curia as long as they remain in good standing with the church.\n\nThe Catholic church was organised into dozens of archbishoprics, each containing many bishoprics, each containing many parishes. One archbishopric could cover a tiny area or a huge one, depending in large part on when it was established. Italy was filled with bishops and archbishops, while countries on the fringe of Christendom had fewer."

Cistercian monks and nuns contemplated God in isolation from society. Their monasteries and abbeys often produced fine ales, cheeses and other goods which the monks traded for things they could not produce. The 'White Monks' reached their zenith in the fifteenth century, but went into a decline after that. Victims of their own success, the order found it difficult to maintain its zeal as it became mainstream."
