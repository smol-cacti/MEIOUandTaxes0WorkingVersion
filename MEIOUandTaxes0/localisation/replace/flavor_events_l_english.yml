 flavor_bav.201.t:1 "From the sixth to eighth century, the Duchy of Bavaria was a frontier region in the southeastern part of the Merovingian kingdom and was ruled by dukes under Frankish lordship. In the late ninth century a new duchy was created from this area. It was one of the stem duchies of the Kingdom of Germany and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBetween 1070 and 1180 the Emperor was opposed by Bavaria, especially by the House of Welf. In the final conflict between Duke Henry the Lion and the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I, Frederick triumphed and deprived Henry of his fiefs. Bavaria then passed over to the House of Wittelsbach. Since there was no preference for succession of the firstborn in the Wittelsbach dynasty, Bavaria was subdivided between different branches of the Wittelsbach dynasty into separate duchies, often at odds with one another.\n\nWe believe ourselves to be the sole legitimate claimant to the united Duchy of Bavaria. No longer shall we abide with mediocrity."

 enlightenment.desc.031:1 "Up until now, political philosophy has been the heirloom of Plato who stated that society was inherently split in casts depending on the nature of the soul, and that of Aristotle who claimed that man was a political animal naturally bound to accept being in any society. Recent philosophers have theorised a new social contract based on the notion of liberty. Several contracts exist, like the search for security, the safeguard of possessions or the equality of all citizens."

 enlightenment.desc.041:1 "Pierre Bayle, French Huguenot, has written a new dictionary, mainly devoted to individual people (whether historical or mythical), but with some articles treating religious beliefs and philosophies. He delights in pointing out the contradictions between theological tenets and supposedly, self-evident dictates of reason. By this sceptical approach, he sought to promote religious tolerance."

 enlightenment.desc.051:1 "One of our barons has been exploring the vast lands overseas, and spent quite some times with the natives there. In \"Dialogues with savage Adario\", he attempts to contrast the injustice of Christianity with the freedom and justice of the native people. His idealized view of \"natural humanity\" as a vehicle for criticising European civilisation has led to the expression \"noble savage\"."

 enlightenment.desc.061:1 "Long suppressed for its blasphemous nature, the concept of a rational affirmation of the existence of God, with a faith governed by Reason and not by the Sacred Texts, is starting to develop among our philosophers. Rejecting the miracles and other supernatural phenomenon, they believe in a \"Supreme Architect\" who does not involve himself in temporal affairs."
