 liberalism_trait_desc:1 "This population is characterised by an 'absolute nuclear family' system, when adult children don't live with parents, and with no strict equal-inheritance custom. The father is free to distribute his possessions among his children by will. Indifferent to the notions of equality and inequality, little devoted to family solidarity, it is an individualistic model. This leads to a very liberal mentality about property, inheritance, order and economy. Individuals will be more likely and efficient to invest and create private businesses; but also less inclined to fight heresies because of their conception of freedom and autonomy. \n§RThis idea is not really giving its modifiers, but your Main Culture is.

 authoritarian_trait:1 "§GFamilial System :§! Authoritarian Family"
 authoritarian_trait_desc:1 "This population is characterised by a 'stem family' system, when one adult child (and his family) lives with parents and others move out; and with no strict equal-inheritance custom. Adult, only one of the sons (elder, younger or chosen by the father) marries and procreates without leaving his parents. Other children have the option of staying single in the family home or going away to marry, become priests or soldiers. These are compensated by cash payments. The cohabitation of two adult generations illustrates the authoritarianism of the system. The transmission of a large part of the patrimony to a single child and the celibacy, more or less accepted, of the others betray the inequality of the model. This leads to a very authoritarian mentality about inheritance, order and discipline. Therefore, this family system is very effective for the education of children and the transmission of values ​​and new knowledge, but also quite self-contained. \n§RThis idea is not really giving its modifiers, but your Main Culture is.

 equality_trait_desc:1 "This population is characterised by an 'egalitarian nuclear family' system, when adult children don't live with parents; and with a strict equal-inheritance custom. The couple made children who, as adults, found independent households. Since the family never develops beyond the parent-child nucleus, this model contributes to individualism. As for the property of the parents, they are shared equitably, meticulously, among the descendants. Hence a very strong sensitivity to the notions of equality. This leads to a very egalitarian mentality about property, inheritance, order and economy. This population has a penchant for universalism and thus is very efficient to export its system of values, even by conquest; but also has a natural reject for order. \n§RThis idea is not really giving its modifiers, but your Main Culture is.

This system corresponds to a community family system where the preferential marriage between first-degree cousins, derived from a hypertrophy of the brother-sister relationship, is observed.

Otto IV was one of the claimants to the Imperial Throne, with a powerbase in Northern Germany, himself being of the House of Welf, and an alliance with England he challenged Frederik II von Hohenstaufen. Due to Danish, French, and Papal support Frederik II emerged victorious. One reason being the support from the Danish King Valdemar, which tied up Otto's vassals, The Danish conquest included Stormarn, Wagrien, Ratzeburg, Travemünde, Lauenburg and the rich trading cities of Hamburg and Lübeck, and with the signing of the Golden Bull even more. The Golden Bull were a significant change to the power balance of Northern Europe, 100 years earlier Denmark had fought the Emperor to avoid becoming vassals themselves. The reasons this was accomplished were the continued centralisation of the Danish state under Knud Lavard, Valdemar the Great, Canute VI and Valdemar the Victorious himself, Denmark had at this point finished a transformation of being a backwards pagan kingdom on the periphery of Europe. To a true modern feudal kingdom integrated into European society, population wise the Kingdom was at its zenith and would only reach the same number of people in the nineteenth century. The result was that the Danish kings were capable of raising large armies that could go toe to toe with anything Europe had to offer."

The fleet were a result of years of preparation and negotiations with Pope Honorius III, which in 1218 allowed Valdemar II to annex as much land as he could conquer in Estonia. The fleet, which included vassals from Rügen, Mecklenburg, Holstein and more is said to have been 1500 ships strong, which if correct would have resulted in an invasion force of 30,000-60,000 men. On landing, the army started to build a castle, which would late be known by the Estonians as Danish Town, or Tallinn. It is here that the Battle of Lyndanisse was fought. A battle where the Estonians tried to throw the invaders back into the sea.

However in the increasingly centralised state that was the Kingdom of Sweden there was an ever-increasing desire to replace these laws with common laws that would apply to the entire realm, landslagar. The first set of landslagar took effect in 1350 under the reign of King Magnus Eriksson and amongst many things these laws made the ownership of thralls (slaves) illegal and established elective monarchy as the form of succession for the Crown of Sweden. While Magnus Erikssons Landslag would be modified throughout history it would remain the basis of the legal system in Sweden until as far as 1734 when it was fully replaced by Sveriges Rikes Lag which remains as the core legal system of both modern day Sweden and Finland."

The Declaration of Arbroath, submitted to Pope John XXII, was part of a larger attempt to cement Scotland's status as an independent power that was not subject to the English. It is notable for many reasons, including for an early mention of the concept of popular sovereignty. The Declaration was signed by 51 Scottish magnates and nobles and it convinced the Pope to try and persuade the English to make peace with the Scots. Although peace would not come for another eight years, the Declaration of Arbroath was integral to the definition of the Scottish state and identity, encapsulated by the famous quote: 'As long as only one hundred of us remain alive we will never on any conditions be brought under English rule.'"

It was rediscovered in the early fifteenth century and was quickly embraced as source of legal authority, given that much of Scottish law documents had been seized and destroyed by the confiscations of Edward I.

 japan_trait:1 "§GBonus Idea :§! Eastern Asia - Japanese Armours"
 japan_trait_desc:1 "Japanese armour is thought to have evolved from the armour used in ancient China and Korea. Cuirasses and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the fourth century. Tankō, worn by foot soldiers and keikō, worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. During the Heian period (794-1185), the Japanese cuirass evolved into the more familiar style of armour worn by the samurai known as the dou or dō. Japanese armour makers started to use leather (nerigawa) and lacquer was used to weather proof the armour parts. By the end of the Heian period the Japanese cuirass had arrived at the shape recognised as being distinctly samurai. Leather and or iron scales were used to construct samurai armours, with leather and eventually silk lace used to connect the individual scales (kozane) which these cuirasses were now being made from."

Gunki Monogatari works emphasised the code of warrior ethics, and were indicative of a hybrid Chinese-Japanese writing style that at times blended prose and poetry. The most famous work of this type is the Heiki Monogatari (or Tale of the Heike), which depicted the twelfth century conflict between the Taira and Minamoto clans during the Genpei War; other prominent works in the genre include the Hogen Monogatari and Heiji Monogatari."

 five_mountain_system_desc:1 "The Five Mountain System refers to a dual set of ranked temples in Kyoto and Kamakura, known as the Gozan, that were both protected and controlled by the Shogunate government. The formalization of the Five Mountain System during the Kemmu Restoration helped to institutionalize the dominance of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism in Japan. Building off an initiative begun by Ashikaga Takauji and Ashikaga Tadayoshi, in 1345 Emperor Kogon issued an edict calling for the development of a series of provincial temples to be constructed throughout Japan, consisting of Ankoku-ji temples (controlled by the local governors) and Risho-to pagodas (controlled by the Gozan), further increasing the influence of the Five Mountain System."

Coming between the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, the Kenmu Restoration was an attempt to restore the power of the Emperor, as opposed to that of the Shogun. Emperor Go-Daigo attempted to rein in the power of the local lords and governors, but failed to properly reward his troops. Corruption was rife and Emperor Go-Daigo quickly became unpopular, especially among the warrior class, and the Emperor was ultimately overthrown by the Ashikaga brothers, Takauji and Tadayoshi, beginning the era of the Ashikaga shogunate and the chaos of the Northern and Southern Courts period."

Though the post of Shugo is said to have been created in 1185 by Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Shugo lords gained a substantial amount of power in the fourteenth century. The Ashikaga installed many related families as Shugo, including the Hosokawa and Shiba, but many other powerful families, like the Togashi and Sasaki, also remained. In 1372, the Shugo lords were given the responsibility to collect taxes known as tansen from all landowners, which greatly enhanced their own power. Though the Ashikaga attempted to rein in the power of the Shugo in the 1380s and 1390s, many Shugo lords remained semi-independent, especially those farther away from the capital."

One of the traditional swords of Japan, the Katana is characterised by its distinctive construction: curved, with a single-edged blade and a long grip large enough to accommodate two hands. The Katana developed from an earlier sword known as a Tachi and, starting around the year 1400, swords signed with the 'Katana' signature were beginning to be produced. With the development of the Katana, samurai began to move away from being archers in favour of swordsmen, as the new sword radically changed the nature of close-combat warfare. The Katana was used into the twentieth century and, even today, it remains largely unchanged from its fourteenth century origins."

Nkisi were not necessarily always seen as malevolent forces, however. When used for selfish purposes, use of Nkondi constituted black magic and witchcraft, but when directed publicly for communal purposes, was a form of positive spiritual protection.

Its medieval city walls were reinforced with modern structures, a close-by hill was built up into a castle and later a command citadel, new Rhine defence batteries were built and later 16 bastion towers were placed in a star formation around the city. Ironically though the state of Kurmainz lacked the soldiers needed to man this fortress and thus it was given up without a siege on several occasions."

 duke_franconia:1 "Duke in Franconia, Güldene Freiheit"
 duke_franconia_desc:1 "In 1168, the legendary emperor Barbarossa awarded the bishops of Würzburg with the title of 'duke in Franconia', a prestigious title that confirmed their local hegemony. However, the title was of symbolic meaning, because it did not convey any power over Franconian territory not in the bishops' hand. They remained only dukes 'in Franconia' but not 'of Franconia'. Because the title and right was preserved in a letter with a golden imperial seal, it was soon dubbed 'Güldene Freiheit'."
 procession:1 "Prozession mit blankem Schwert"
 procession_desc:1 "To remind the world of their status as imperial dukes and thus arbiters with kinglike legislation, the bishops used to have a bare sword (blankes Schwert) carried in front of them on their ecclesial processions at Whitsun or Easter. After canonical church law though, Würzburg still remained a Suffragan ('vassal') of the archbishopric of Mainz."
 monasteries:1 "Control over the Monasteries and Abbeys"

 wolfskeel_desc:1 "The noble family of von Wolfskeel was very influential in the institutions of the bishopric. Several of them were even ordained as bishops of Würzburg."
 wildbann:1 "Wildbann"
 wildbann_desc:1 "Franconia was filled with vast forests, like the Spessart in its south western corner. The 'Wildbann', roughly 'deer-ban', was a law that restricted the usage of these forests. In earlier centuries it marked forests where only the king was allowed to hunt, but later it was also used to justify and claim clearings and new settlements on former forest territory of any kind, even if the woods were long gone, thus a common excuse for fabricated claims."
 kanzleikammer:1 "Kanzlei und Kammer"
 kanzleikammer_desc:1 "During the Renaissance, the bishops' secretary Lorenz Fries set out to reform the various administrative units of Würzburg and to archive and order the 'hohe Registratur', the 'high registry', which contained all information about the belongings, history and law customs of the bishopric. The efficient administration of offices and chamberlains under the severe supervision of the bishop and his secret council turned out to be modern and effective."

Even a cable car, the 'Reißzug', was constructed."

 mines_desc:1 "The mountains around Salzburg were rich of minerals and metals, but like the name Salzburg - literally 'salt mountain' - implies, salt was the greatest treasure hidden in the mountains.

 albertinische_und_ernestinische_linie_desc:1 "The House of Wettin, in spite of the principle of primogeniture which was linked to the Kurwürde, was prone to dividing their turf among all of their sons which led to a number of cadet lines and accompanying conflicts over territorial divisions, thus throwing back the consolidation process of a uniform domain several times. Only the Albertine line finally went back to primogeniture in 1499, while the Ernestines continued this practise well into the nineteenth century, resulting in a score of small dukedoms in present day Thuringia."
 silberbergbau:1 "Silberbergbau"
 silberbergbau_desc:1 "As early as the twelfth century silver was found aplenty in the Ore Mountains. The mining industry continued to strive well into the seventeenth century and provided the prince-elector of Saxony with a huge and steady income. This - combined with the trade revenues from Leipzig - made them largely independent from the Landstände, whose agreement was mandatory for direct taxes. Although they had a large income, the Wettins were also inclined on overspending this money, a problem which reached its peak in the late seventeenth century with August II."

It was much more significant than the university of Wittenberg, which fame is mainly founded on Luther and the reformation.

In 1190 Otto the Rich, margrave of Saxony instigated two trade fairs in Leipzig, at Easter (Jubilate) and Michaelmas. No other fair was to be held up to a mile (1.6 km) away (Marktbann), and the bridges and streets were freed from toll. The Michaelmas fair was held at the church of St. Nikolai, built in 1176. At this time, there were fairs at other Saxon towns like Freiberg, Leisnig, Pegau, and Regis as well. In 1268 all foreign merchants travelling to or living in Leipzig got safe conduct for their persons and their goods, even if their Rulers were at war with Saxony. This led to the settlement of numerous merchants in Leipzig. Trade goods now included herring, cloth, wine, and pepper."

This design proved so effective that it dominated warfare in the Isles well into the sixteenth century.
