 POP_dev_button_interactions.700.t: "Visiting with Tribal Leaders"
 POP_dev_button_interactions.700.d: "The Tribes consist of people who often live on marginal lands or have earlier forms of local, decentralised governments. Because the organisation of their societies rely more on personal relations rather than the rule of law, they can be difficult to control. A province controlled by the tribal estate will pour most or all of its wealth into the people of the tribe itself and disposable goods. What this means is that tribal estates have very mediocre growth in development but can sustain a significantly higher levy per capita than other estates.\n\nBecause tribal estates have mediocre development and are often on marginal land, they will much more frequently defer to warfare and looting as a means of economic enrichment. This also means that the easiest way to make your tribes happy is to have them participate in wars that yield significant loot. Unfortunately, this also means the best way to upset them is to bring them into wars that waste their resources. All wealth that is normally generated in a tribal province goes directly to the tribal estate. You can move a tribal estate away from tribalism and toward nobility if you institute various rules to restrain and contain their activity and direct it toward economic objectives.\n\nTribal Wealth: [Root.ptm_subtribe_wealth.GetValue]¤\nAnnual Wealth Decay: ~7.5%\nAnnual Income: [Root.ptm_subtribe_treasury_annual.GetValue]¤\nPower in $COUNTRY$: [Root.ptm_subtribe_power_share.GetValue]% among tribes.\nLoyal Host: [Root.ptm_subtribe_infantry_host.GetValue]£infantry_icon_small£ [Root.ptm_subtribe_cavalry_host.GetValue]£cavalry_icon_small£\n\n"

Then, the distance is increased by whether or not the art centres share a same area/region/subcontinent/continent.
