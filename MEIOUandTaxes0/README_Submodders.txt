The M&T game files are split in two versions. One for players, meant to be used to play the game, and one for
submodders, meant for changing the game code and creating submods.

These files are the SUBMODDER VERSION of M&T

If you are a submodder, please go to the Paradox Forum M&T section and download the modding version instead,
that will make your life a lot easier.
