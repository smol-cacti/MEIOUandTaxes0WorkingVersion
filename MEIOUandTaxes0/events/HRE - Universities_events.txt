# TODO: Make it a construction instead of instant building add. Will require check for ongoing construction though!
# TODO: Maybe make sure that the regional city will actually be able to educate country students?
# TODO: Move the build-university-and-subtract-local-wealth routine to scripted effect (it's also used in "HRE - University_decisions")


# For some time period from game start HRE princes (and other catholic nations) without a (papal-chartered) university in their region may ask pope to charter one.
# This may be built in a nearby province if asker has no good city (a la Count Palatinate founding Koln university)
# Additionally during western Schism the Roman Pope should issue bulls to found German universities to educate students that can't go to Avignionist Paris university
# Historic examples: Koln, several in scotland apparently, probably all the ones already handled by static events (krakow, vienna, pecs),
# Erfurt (Actually by Avignon pope because history is never clean and simple, but it seems to be the only one), Heidelberg.


# This event doesn't take into account scaling building costs,
# I handwave it as pious individuals/the church giving up land for cheap/free because it's papal sponsored
# Also because scaling costs would be more complicated to handle and I'm lazy
# These charters will be so rare that it's not a big issue either way

# Chose among possible locations for the chartered university (If any exist)
