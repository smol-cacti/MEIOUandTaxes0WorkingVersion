[*]'Baltic' trade node renamed to 'Stockholm'.
[*]Adjacency and positions fixes.
[*]Removed one decision (the Millet System) which was causing the game to freeze.
[*]Restored the piety and church influence systems for all countries, which will restore the functionality of several events and decisions.
[*]Removed several Paradox decisions and events which add reform_desire to the game. This will have the effect of having the Reformation start later, although it is still likely to fire decades before it historically did (the lowering events aren't scripted yet, and I'm still tracking down one or two Paradox events giving more reform desire). Now, however, we're talking 1460, not 1370.
[*]Added a triggered modifier so the player has an idea what their piety level is without checking their tolerance.
[*]Changed the triggers of a few triggered modifiers so they properly check the right provinces. Temporarily removed a few that were looking at the wrong province due to lack of time to fix them properly.
[*]The 'Act of Supremacy' decision now should properly have several effects on your country, although mostly invisible. Some of the effects were not included, unfortunately, due to a recurring bug with the DG_Catholic event file which forced me to not include the changes until the bug is found and fixed.

[*]Two Paradox localisation files are now included, with sections missing, so that Dei Gratia changes to Patriarch Authority and Piety show up properly.
[*]Archbishoprics now properly show up, and countries that own them gain a bonus to papal influence at the beginning of the game as well as a small bonus throughout the game.  They are in historical locations, meaning that Italy is a tempting prize for someone wishing to become Papal Controller.
[*]The 'Witch Hunt' event now has proper localisation for all three of its options.
[*]Two events now reduce reform desire slightly; jubilee years and starting a church council (church councils always fail, however - the event chains are not finished).
